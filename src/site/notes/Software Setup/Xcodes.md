Xcodes is an app to manage the installation of different versions of Xcode:

You can directly [download Xcodes](https://github.com/XcodesOrg/xcodesapp/releases/latest.zip) here; an [overview of the app can be found here](https://www.xcodes.app).

Once downloaded, you will have a compressed file:

Double-click the file to de-compress it, then drag the resulting Xcodes app to your Applications folder:

The most recent version of Xcode available, as of January 19, 2023, is Xcode 14.2:

Later today or tomorrow, when your computer will not be used for a half hour or so, please upgrade to Xcode 14.2 using the Xcodes app.

The Xcodes app makes this easy; just be sure to use, from the menu bar, **Xcodes > Settings..**, then select the **Sign-in** button under **Apple ID**:

...and then provide your LCS Apple ID information (this is what gives you access to Apple Developer resources).
  
You can then use Xcodes to remove older versions of Xcode from your computer before or after installing Xcode 14.2 (depending on how much available disk space you have).
