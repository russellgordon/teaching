- A partner to engage in the *Driver-Navigator* paired programming model.

## Success criteria
- [ ] a regular triangle, square, and pentagon are drawn, separated by some empty space
- [ ] code includes [[Style/Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Style/Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently|correctly indented]]
