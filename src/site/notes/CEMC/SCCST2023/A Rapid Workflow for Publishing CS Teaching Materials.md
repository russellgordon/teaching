# A Rapid Workflow for Publishing CS Teaching Materials

## Summary

It is both a feature and a bug of Computer Studies courses that there are few, if any, published textbooks that match the Ontario curriculum. As a result, most teachers write their own materials and have developed a workflow that fits their needs to share lessons and instructions with their students. In this session, the presenter will share a workflow that maximizes time we can spend communicating ideas and minimizes friction and time spent actually publishing and disseminating those materials. Bring your laptop computer: this is a hands-on session where you will set up the complete publishing workflow and learn how to use Markdown-formatted text files to quickly publish code snippets, diagrams, animations, and searchable, deeply linked pages to the web. Break free from manually typesetting documents in HTML or a word processor.
