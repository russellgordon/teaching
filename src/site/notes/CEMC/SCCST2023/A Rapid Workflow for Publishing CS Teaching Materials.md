# A Rapid Workflow for Publishing CS Teaching Materials

## Summary

It is both a feature and a bug of Computer Studies courses that there are few, if any, published textbooks that match the Ontario curriculum. As a result, most teachers write their own materials and have developed a workflow that fits their needs to share lessons and instructions with their students. In this session, the presenter will share a workflow that maximizes time we can spend communicating ideas and minimizes friction and time spent actually publishing and disseminating those materials. Bring your laptop computer: this is a hands-on session where you will set up the complete publishing workflow and learn how to use Markdown-formatted text files to quickly publish code snippets, diagrams, animations, and searchable, deeply linked pages to the web. Break free from manually typesetting documents in HTML or a word processor.

> [!NOTE]
> This material was initially shared on Thursday, August 17, 2023 at the [Summer Conference for Computer Studies Teachers](https://cemc2.math.uwaterloo.ca/events/sinstitute/), organized by the  [Centre for Education in Mathematics and Computing](https://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca).

## Output examples

[A lesson](https://ics3u-2023.russellgordon.dev/concepts/lists/) that the author, in the past, might have conveyed using a PDF file (exported from presentation software) or with a video.

An [end-of-module task](https://ics3u-2023.russellgordon.dev/tasks/reproduce-an-interface/) for students to complete to demonstrate learning goal mastery.

A [course website](https://ics3u-2023.russellgordon.dev/section-1/home/) (half of the author's ICS3U course from 2022-23).

## Resources

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All illustrations were made using macOS, but this is an entirely cross-platform workflow that has also been tested on Windows. 
> 
> Obsidian is a key piece of the workflow. Obsidian runs on Linux, but publishing from that operating system has not been tested by the author.
