# Template

## Install the template

One of the more time-consuming aspects of setting up a course website using Obsidian is deciding upon a structure for that site.

Assuming that you have followed the [[CEMC/SCCST2023/Publishing Setup\|steps to create a website]] provided in this session, you can follow these steps to install a template that you are welcome to modify.

1. Download [this compressed file](https://russellgordon.ca/SiteTemplate.zip) and de-compress it.
   
   It contains the structure of the [example site provided here](https://ics3u-2023.mrgordon.tech/section-1/home/), with all attachments (images and animations) removed ‚Äì these add up to more than 800 MB of data that you will not need.
   
   Navigate to the vault folder for a course website that you have set up and move or copy the de-compressed files into the vault folder ‚Äì¬†you can optionally choose whether to over-write the existing **Attachments** folder:

2. After placing the new files into your vault folder, they will immediately appear in Obsidian. 
   
   You can explore the structure provided and modify as needed.
   
   This template assumes you are running multiple sections of the same course:

   You would provide the URL of the **Home** note to students in a given section of a course:

A deployment should automatically be triggered on Netlify, after which on the live site you should be able to search across the site content using the field provided or the `Command-K` or `Control-K` keyboard shortcuts:

And navigate search results, using the keyboard:
