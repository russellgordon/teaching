# Introduction to the Environment

This is what you should see when you open the **Grade 9 Coding** playground:

![Screenshot 2022-12-20 at 7.10.23 AM.png|700](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202022-12-20%20at%207.10.23%20AM.png)

We write code, or *instructions* for the turtle at left.

At right, we see the result of our instructions being run.

To run our instructions, we can use the **Command-R** keyboard shortcut, or press **Run My Code**.

We can also *step* through the code, one line at a time, by using the **Shift-Command-R** keyboard shortcut, or by pressing **Step Through My Code**.

Begin by adding this code to the playground:

```swift
turtle.drawSelf()
turtle.forward(distance: 100)
turtle.drawSelf()
```

Then step through the code. This is what you should see:

We see:

- The turtle draws itself, at it's current *position* and *heading*
- The turtle draws a line 100 units long
- The turtle draws itself again, at it's current *position* and *heading*
