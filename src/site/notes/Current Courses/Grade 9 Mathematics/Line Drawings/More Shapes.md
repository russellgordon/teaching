# More shapes

You might want to practice more with moving the turtle around and drawing some simple shapes.

If so, try having the turtle pick it's pen up:

```swift
turtle.penUp()
```

... move somewhere else on the canvas:

```swift
turtle.forward(distance: 100)
```

... put it's pen down:

```swift
turtle.penDown()
```

...and then draw a square, regular pentagon, or both – something like this:

Try drawing those shapes if you'd like. 😎
