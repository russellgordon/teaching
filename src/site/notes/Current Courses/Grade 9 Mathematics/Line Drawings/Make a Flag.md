# Make a Flag

You might want more practice with moving the turtle around and drawing some simple shapes.

If so, try having the turtle pick it's pen up, move it somewhere else on the canvas, and then draw a square or regular pentagon.

If you're ready for a challenge, try [drawing the flag from a country of your choice](https://worldflags.net/all-flags).

Aim to make the flag as big as possible on the canvas – but maintain the correct aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width and height of the flag).
