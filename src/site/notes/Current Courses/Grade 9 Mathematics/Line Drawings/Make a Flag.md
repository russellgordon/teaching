# Make a Flag

Try [drawing the flag from a country of your choice](https://worldflags.net/all-flags).

For example, here is the flag of Ukraine, a good choice for getting started since the shapes involved are relatively straightforward:

Aim to make the flag as big as possible on the canvas – but be sure maintain the correct aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width and height of the flag).

After you make one flag, you might like to try making a second that is more challenging.

If you do, just duplicate your existing playground to make a new one:

> [!NOTE]
> Once you make a duplicate, it's a good idea to rename the playground so that things stay organized, as shown in the animation above.
