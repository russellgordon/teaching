# Purpose of Coding

*Why* should we write code and create software?

Best case, big picture: good software *helps people* by solving problems.

Sometimes problems are small – like passing time while waiting for a taxi.

Sometimes problems are big – like navigating how to deliver a baby when there is not a doctor present.

For nearly any given problem there is almost certainly *an app for that*.

If there's not?

That's where you come in.

That's what special about writing code and creating software.

In nearly no time, you can go from *identifying a problem* to *having a solution* in the form of an app.

Steve Jobs once said that [a computer is like a bicycle for the mind](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ob_GX50Za6c).

Coding is a means to quickly bring your ideas to life.
