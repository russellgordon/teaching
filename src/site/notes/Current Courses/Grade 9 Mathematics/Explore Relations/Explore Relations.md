# Explore Relations

Mathematics can be understood through coding, too.

You may be familiar with these relations:

Do you remember what effect changing each of the four transformation parameters:

$a$, $k$, $d$, and $c$

...has on the graph of a relation?

Download the [**Exploring Relations**](https://russellgordon.ca/mth1w/exploring-relations.zip) playground, then [[Current Courses/Grade 9 Mathematics/Importing the Exploring Relations Playground\|import it into the Playgrounds app]].

- Try drawing various linear and quadratic relations by changing $a$, $k$, $d$, and $c$ values.
- For a nice challenge, look at how the `linear` and `quadratic` functions are defined near the top of the playground's code.
	- Do you think you could work out how to add a function named `cubic` that would provide appropriate output?
		- Feel free to copy and paste the `quadratic` function, then rename it to `cubic` to get started.
		- When you've finished making changes to your new `cubic` function, use it within your playground to draw a few cubic relations.
	- Could you make a `squareRoot` function?
	- An `absoluteValue` function?
	- How about a `reciprocal` function?
