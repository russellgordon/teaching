# Coding to Directly Explore Mathematics

We can explore relations by using:

- sequence (order of statements)
- iteration (looping)
- abstraction (functions)

For example:

Here is a closer look at the code:

Here is a closer look at the visual output:

If understanding relations and their transformations interests you, this can be done by coding also!
