# What is Coding?

As a loose term, *coding* means to provide instructions to a computer.

Coding is also called *programming*.

Think of your most literal friend, who takes everything you say exactly at face value.

That is sort of what it's like to program a computer!

You must be very specific about what you want the computer to do.

It cannot *infer* or guess at your intentions.

Like spoken languages, you can program a computer using different languages.

The programming language you will use today is called [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) and is both [multi-platform and open-source](https://www.swift.org).
