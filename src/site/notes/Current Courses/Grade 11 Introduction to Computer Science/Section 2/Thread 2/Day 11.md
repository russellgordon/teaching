### Thread 2, Day 11 - Monday, January 30, 2023

#### Agenda

1. Mid-module Portfolio Reviews
	- An informal check-in on your progress with:
		- Building user interfaces
		- Applying abstraction to eliminate repetitive code
		- Understanding how to use lists / arrays
		- Writing apps that accept input, process it, and produce output
	
2. Optionals
	- You already understand how to use typical data types such as `Int`, `Double`, `String`, and `Bool`
	- You have built applications that accept user input as a `Double` via the `Slider` structure in SwiftUI
		- Sliders prevent the user from providing invalid input
			- This is *very* helpful
			- However, it can be hard to select a precise value
		- Sometimes, it would be preferable to accept typed input from the user
			- But what happens when invalid input is received from a user?
			- For example, we might expect numeric input, but the user could type `fifty` rather than `50`
		- This is when the notion of an *optional* data type becomes useful
	- Please [fork and clone this project](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/Optionals)
		- Using your black notebook, try each page of the playground
		- Take your time – *read for understanding* – write down your responses to the questions posed in your black book
		- When you are done – *summarize* in writing what you have learned in your [Spaces post](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) for today – as well as any questions you have
			- ==Be sure to include several screenshots== showing your progress as you completed the playground
			  
3. [Guessing Game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/115TicwDBnw2_fh8voV2w8QAoHkn2tvrh/view?usp=share_link)
	- An an *optional* challenge (pun intended) have a look at [this partial recap of operators, and introduction to *selection statements*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WkbUxvZP6OyHjh5JU8LK-TreGBTgv7DB/view?usp=share_link)
	- See if you can make use of a slider, a button, and a selection statement to implement a "guessing game"
		- The game should work [[Media/Guessing Game|as shown in this short animation]]
		- Before you start coding, try to explain the logic to yourself in writing, in sentence form in your black notebook... *then* open Xcode...
		- Here is [a bit of code to get you started](https://gist.github.com/lcs-rgordon/2efcb3b3be23ef3c07f86aa3d2f105e6)... it is deliberately incomplete... you will need to copy this into a project that you create... see if you can fill in what's missing to complete the game. 
	  
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Complete the first two items described above.
- [ ] Optionally, attempt the third.
