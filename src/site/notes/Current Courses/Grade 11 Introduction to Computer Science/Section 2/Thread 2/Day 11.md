### Thread 2, Day 11 - Monday, January 30, 2023

#### Agenda

1. Mid-module Portfolio Reviews
	- An informal check-in on your progress with:
		- Building user interfaces
		- Applying abstraction to eliminate repetitive code
		- Understanding how to use lists / arrays
		- Writing apps that accept input, process it, and produce output
	
2. Optionals
	- You already understand how to use typical data types such as `Int`, `Double`, `String`, and `Bool`
	- You have built applications that accept user input as a `Double` via the `Slider` structure in SwiftUI
		- Sliders prevent the user from providing invalid input
			- This is *very* helpful
			- However, it can be hard to select a precise value
		- Sometimes, it would be preferable to accept typed input from the user
			- But what happens when invalid input is received from a user?
			- For example, we might expect numeric input, but the user could type `fifty` rather than `50`
		- This is when the notion of an *optional* data type becomes useful
	- Please [fork and clone this project](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/Optionals)
		- Using your black notebook, try each page of the playground
		- Take your time – *read for understanding* – write down your responses to the questions posed in your black book
		- When you are done – *summarize* in writing what you have learned in your [Spaces post](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) for today – as well as any questions you have
			- ==Be sure to include several screenshots== showing your progress as you completed the playground
