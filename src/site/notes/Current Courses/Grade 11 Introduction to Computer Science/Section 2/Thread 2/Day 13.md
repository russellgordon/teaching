1. [Guessing Game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/115TicwDBnw2_fh8voV2w8QAoHkn2tvrh/view?usp=share_link)
	- Working in pairs today... you may select partner... *Driver-Navigator* pattern.
	- Have a look at [this partial recap of operators, and introduction to *selection statements*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WkbUxvZP6OyHjh5JU8LK-TreGBTgv7DB/view?usp=share_link)
	- See if your group can make use of a slider, a button, and a selection statement to implement a "guessing game"
		- The game should work [[Media/Guessing Game\|as shown in this short animation]]
		- Before you start coding, try to explain the logic in writing, in sentence form, on a whiteboard... *then* open Xcode... and make a new project named `GuessingGame`.
		- Commit and push work regularly.
		- Here is [a bit of code to get things started](https://gist.github.com/lcs-rgordon/2efcb3b3be23ef3c07f86aa3d2f105e6)... it is deliberately incomplete... copy this into the project that was created... see if your group can fill in what's missing to complete the game. 
		- Once implemented using a slider for input, *then* try changing it to accept text-based input from the user.
