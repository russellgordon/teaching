#### Agenda
1. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Snippets/Providing Evidence in Your Portfolio\|Portfolio: Providing evidence for learning goals]]
2. [Discussion: Grouping Related Info with Structures](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0c3lUIjNqbjj8K8bGm2SN5eiQ#2a_-_Discussion_-_Grouping_Related_Info_with_Structures)
	- Key takeaways:
		- Use `CapitalCase` when naming structures.
		- Use `camelCase` when naming properties and instances of structures.
		- **DRY**
			- Don't repeat yourself.
			- If you are designing structures to describe data, and find that you have repetitive sections of code, there is usually going to be a better way to organize things.
