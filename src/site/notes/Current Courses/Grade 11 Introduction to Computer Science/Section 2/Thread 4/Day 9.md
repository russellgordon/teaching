#### Agenda

	- Are you authoring an app that writes to a database? Allows the user to categorize data? Something [[Media/Categorizing Data in the Favourite Movies App\|like this]]?
		- If so, the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Recaps/Thread 3 - Modeling Data#1 â€“ Databases\|thread 3 recap on databases]] to build Favourite Movies, and the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Topics/Databases/Designing a Database with Relational Data\|extension tutorial on how to design database tables to be joined]], will be helpful.
	- When stuck, use your ðŸ¦†, use each other for help, use Mr. Gordon, or take a break.
	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> Use of machine learning assistants (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and similar software) is not permitted for any part the culminating task. The express purpose of the culminating task is to demonstrate your understanding of concepts and vocabulary learned this year in the course. Use of a machine learning assistant or other "AI" software will be considered an academic honesty violation and [handled as described in the School Life Guide](https://lcs.myschoolapp.com/ftpimages/108/download/download_4338056.pdf#page=58).
