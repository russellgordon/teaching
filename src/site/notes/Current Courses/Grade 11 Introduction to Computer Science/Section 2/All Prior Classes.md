	- If you haven't yet, finish the **Thinking** section of the task
		- Complete both rounds of paper prototyping
		- Identify the inputs and outputs to your app
	- **Then** begin working on code for your app.
	- If you are working on an app where the user categorizes data they are entering, [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Topics/Databases/Designing a Database with Relational Data\|this tutorial will be useful]]

> [!TIP]
> If you are building an app that relies on user entry of data, and you wish let the user categorize that data, you may be interested in learning how to build an extension to **Favourite Movies**, from [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Recaps/Thread 3 - Modeling Data#1 – Databases\|the thread 3 databases recap]], that looks like this:

### Thread 2, Day 14 - Thursday, February 2, 2023

#### Agenda

1. **Finding Square Roots**
	- You can [review the history of commits for this project](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SquareRootExample/commits/main) to understand the simplest possible flow for handling user input that is expected to be numeric.
	  ![Screenshot 2023-02-04 at 12.00.44 PM.png|200](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202023-02-04%20at%2012.00.44%20PM.png)
	- We must [take a `String`](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SquareRootExample/blob/3ceda8db37afa243b7bc7dce476e83f95dee1e80/SquareRootExample/Views/CalculationView.swift#L15), [convert it to an optional `Double`](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SquareRootExample/blob/3ceda8db37afa243b7bc7dce476e83f95dee1e80/SquareRootExample/Views/CalculationView.swift#L21-L31), then [unwrap the optional to a regular `Double` so we can do arithmetic](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SquareRootExample/blob/3ceda8db37afa243b7bc7dce476e83f95dee1e80/SquareRootExample/Views/CalculationView.swift#L37-L42) with the value, and [finally, produce `String` output](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SquareRootExample/blob/3ceda8db37afa243b7bc7dce476e83f95dee1e80/SquareRootExample/Views/CalculationView.swift#L48-L50) again:
		```mermaid
		flowchart LR
		
		id1["Step 1\nString"] --> id2["Step 2\nDouble?"]
		id2 --> id3["Step 3\nDouble"]
		id3 --> id4["Step 4\nString"]
		```
2. **Share the Bill:** Opportunities for Further Abstraction
	- A complete example that ties together all concepts we have learned so far in this module
		- Optionally, you can review how it was built, [step by step](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ShareTheBill/commits/main)
		- In the list of commits, click the commit details badge to see what changed within [that specific commit](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ShareTheBill/commit/678934e4a982a17d1bced0139ac69aca02d20895):
		  ![Screenshot 2023-02-02 at 12.53.52 PM.png|650](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202023-02-02%20at%2012.53.52%20PM.png)
	- Please [fork and clone the repository for this app now](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ShareTheBill)
		- With a partner, review the code within the `body` property
			- What opportunities for eliminating repetitive code do you see?
			- Let's improve this now...
			> [!NOTE]
			> We skipped this conversation in class due to time constraints, but here is a [video addressing how to apply abstraction to eliminate repetitive code](https://youtu.be/32h66muzU4Q). This was recorded in the other section of Grade 11 Intro to Computer Science.
2. **Share the Bill:** Add a Second Tab to Show History
	- Data to be saved within an app should be created in one location only
		- Put another way, a given piece of data must have just one *single source of truth*
		- Currently this occurs with the `@State` property wrapper
		- How, though, can we share data between screens?
		- That is where the `@Binding` property wrapper is useful
			- In brief:
				```mermaid
				flowchart TD
				
				id1["App Entry Point\n@State"] --> id2["Screen 1\n@Binding"]
				id1 --> id3["Screen 2\n@Binding"]
				```
			- Let's examine this together now...
			> [!NOTE]
			> Here is the [short video summarizing this – how to use @Binding to share data between screens](https://youtu.be/9q_AMRCr5dA). This was recorded in the other section of Grade 11 Intro to Computer Science.

### Thread 2, Day 13 - Wednesday, February 1, 2023

#### Agenda

1. [Guessing Game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/115TicwDBnw2_fh8voV2w8QAoHkn2tvrh/view?usp=share_link)
	- Working in pairs today... you may select partner... *Driver-Navigator* pattern.
	- Have a look at [this partial recap of operators, and introduction to *selection statements*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WkbUxvZP6OyHjh5JU8LK-TreGBTgv7DB/view?usp=share_link)
	- See if your group can make use of a slider, a button, and a selection statement to implement a "guessing game"
		- The game should work [[Media/Guessing Game\|as shown in this short animation]]
		- Before you start coding, try to explain the logic in writing, in sentence form, on a whiteboard... *then* open Xcode... and make a new project named `GuessingGame`.
		- Commit and push work regularly.
		- Here is [a bit of code to get things started](https://gist.github.com/lcs-rgordon/2efcb3b3be23ef3c07f86aa3d2f105e6)... it is deliberately incomplete... copy this into the project that was created... see if your group can fill in what's missing to complete the game. 
		- Once implemented using a slider for input, *then* try changing it to accept text-based input from the user.
		  
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Complete the items described above.

### Thread 2, Day 12 - Tuesday, January 31, 2023

#### Agenda

1. Optionals and Data Input
	- Learn how to use optionals to safely handle user input.
	- Please [fork and clone this project](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/OptionalsAndDataInput)
		- Using your black notebook, try each page of the playground
		- Take your time – *read for understanding* – write down your responses to the questions posed in your black book
		- When you are done – *summarize* in writing what you have learned in your [Spaces post](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) for today – as well as any questions you have
			- ==Be sure to include several screenshots== showing your progress as you completed the playground
	
2. Exercise: Convert an Existing Program to Text-based Input

### Thread 2, Day 11 - Monday, January 30, 2023

#### Agenda

1. Mid-module Portfolio Reviews
	- An informal check-in on your progress with:
		- Building user interfaces
		- Applying abstraction to eliminate repetitive code
		- Understanding how to use lists / arrays
		- Writing apps that accept input, process it, and produce output
	
2. Optionals
	- You already understand how to use typical data types such as `Int`, `Double`, `String`, and `Bool`
	- You have built applications that accept user input as a `Double` via the `Slider` structure in SwiftUI
		- Sliders prevent the user from providing invalid input
			- This is *very* helpful
			- However, it can be hard to select a precise value
		- Sometimes, it would be preferable to accept typed input from the user
			- But what happens when invalid input is received from a user?
			- For example, we might expect numeric input, but the user could type `fifty` rather than `50`
		- This is when the notion of an *optional* data type becomes useful
	- Please [fork and clone this project](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/Optionals)
		- Using your black notebook, try each page of the playground
		- Take your time – *read for understanding* – write down your responses to the questions posed in your black book
		- When you are done – *summarize* in writing what you have learned in your [Spaces post](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) for today – as well as any questions you have
			- ==Be sure to include several screenshots== showing your progress as you completed the playground
	  
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Complete the first two items described above.
- [ ] Optionally, attempt the third.

### Thread 1, Day 13 - Wednesday, November 9, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [SF Symbols App](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)
	- Not all software developers have graphic design skills.
	- Platform owners like Apple want their users to have a consistent experience when using apps written by different people.
	- One of the ways Apple helps their developers provide that consistent look and feel is by offering a wide variety of built-in images that can be used in apps.
	- Please [download and install](https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/design/resources/download/SF-Symbols-4.dmg) the SF Symbols app now.
2. [Views and Controls App](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ViewsAndControls)
	- This Xcode project includes examples of how to use many common user interface elements that are present in iOS apps.
	- Please [go to the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ViewsAndControls) and then [[Media/Cloning Views and Controls Project\|clone a copy to use]] for future reference.
	- Here is a brief example of [[Media/Using Views and Controls Project\|how to use the project to review examples]].
3. SwiftUI: [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Topics/SwiftUI/Reproducing the Digital Stopwatch Interface, Part 1\|Reproducing the Stopwatch App]]
	- In this tutorial, learn how to apply some concepts we've already learned, as well as a few new ones, to build the user interface for a professional app.
	  
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Finish the tutorial to reproduce the Stopwatch user interface

### Thread 1, Day 12 - Monday, November 7, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [Learning Skills Self-Assessment](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/00b26u1fleLzktdRsJ-nWhS_Q#Learning_Skills_Self-Assessment)
	- Last week you completed in-person interviews with Mr. Gordon to discuss your achievement to date.
	- You set goals for improvement over the next two weeks to complete this module.
	- *Learning skills* drive achievement.
		- That is, if you have strong learning skills, the rest often takes care of itself.
	- Please self-evaluate your learning skills for this course to date.
		- When completed, take a photo of your self-assessment and please post it [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) in the *private* portfolio space.
2. [Source Control: Quick reference](https://www.russellgordon.ca/cs/source-control/introduction/using-source-control.pdf)
	- From last week's class, please glue this inside the front cover of your black hardcover notebook.
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Topics/SwiftUI/Composition of Views Using Custom Structures\|SwiftUI: Composition of Views Using Custom Structures]]
	- Remember **D.R.Y.** ?
		- *Don't repeat yourself.*
	- We can write our own structures that conform to the `View` protocol.
		- These custom structures build upon the structures like `VStack`, `HStack`, `ScrollView`, et cetera that are provided by Apple through the SwiftUI framework.
		- By using custom structures, we avoid having to make repetitive changes to our code.
		- As well, the overall number of lines of code that it takes to write an app is much lower.
4. Exercise: Improving the List View in **FavouriteThings**
	- Currently, the list view looks like this:
	  ![Screen Shot 2022-11-06 at 11.05.42 AM.png|200](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-06%20at%2011.05.42%20AM.png)
	- `NavigationLink` labels can show *any* view, not just a `Text` view.
	- Using your new knowledge from yesterday's class about how to combine `VStack` and `HStack` structures, and from today's class about how to create a new custom structure, modify your project so that the list view looks like this instead:	  
	  ![Screen Shot 2022-11-06 at 11.03.53 AM.png|200](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-06%20at%2011.03.53%20AM.png)
	> [!HINT]
	> To re-use existing images in your app and show a smaller square thumbnail, the view modifiers shown here will do the trick:
	> ![Screen Shot 2022-11-06 at 11.11.14 AM.png|400](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-06%20at%2011.11.14%20AM.png)
#### To-do items

### Thread 1, Day 11 - Saturday, November 5, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Reference Book: SwiftUI Views Quick Start
	- Many programmers refer to *reference books* as they learn
	- Mark Moeykens is a talented author of technical reference books, who runs [Big Mountain Studio](https://www.bigmountainstudio.com)
	- He wrote an outstanding book named **SwiftUI Views Quick Start**, and generously provides it free of charge
		- ==To simplify matters while I am away from class today, you can [directly access a copy of SwiftUI Views Quick Start here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19q9TiI0C3TJW7SGUavhA0sezGZceDNBH/view?usp=share_link)==
			- To access the file, you need to be logged in to your LCS Google account
			- You may wish to download that PDF file directly to your computer for use in the future
				- To download the PDF file, look for this icon in the top-right corner of your browser  window: 
				![Screen Shot 2022-11-05 at 6.25.51 AM.png|600](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-05%20at%206.25.51%20AM.png)
		- Other books Mark authored are also excellent, but are not provided free of charge
			- These books cover more advanced topics that you may choose to use later this year or in the grade 12 computer science course
2. SwiftUI: Basic Concepts and Terms
	- From the [SwiftUI Views Quick Start](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19q9TiI0C3TJW7SGUavhA0sezGZceDNBH/view?usp=share_link) book, please read through the *Basic Concepts* section from pages 12 to 20 in the PDF file
		- This will only take you a few minutes
1. SwiftUI: Understanding Mark's `HeaderView`
	- When you see code it's important that how it works is not a mystery to you
		- Mark includes the same standard layout at the start of all his code examples and screenshots
		- This layout is created from a SwiftUI view named `HeaderView`
		- To understand how `HeaderView` works, please review the *My Template* section from [pages 31 to 39 of the Swift UI Views Quick Start](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19q9TiI0C3TJW7SGUavhA0sezGZceDNBH/view?usp=share_link)
		- This is a good initial example of how to do basic formatting in SwiftUI
		- ==It is often easier to learn by trying things out as you go.==
			- So, you are asked to:
				- [create a new project in Xcode, of type iOS App, named **HeaderExample**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5pwFrmgcNk)
				- then, as you read pages 31 to 39, try typing in the code Mark provides within the `body` property in his examples
2. Exercise: Experiment with SwiftUI Layouts
	- **Option 1:** Extend Name Badge
		- Go back to the Name Badge project we started in a prior class.
		- Make the view's visual appearance look like this:
		  ![Screen Shot 2022-11-05 at 7.08.34 AM.png|300](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-05%20at%207.08.34%20AM.png)
		- If you wish, use the complete [SwiftUI Views Quick Start book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19q9TiI0C3TJW7SGUavhA0sezGZceDNBH/view?usp=share_link) as a reference, or, refer to [this PDF that contains a subset of concepts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KowxWGeBQGdbW6PtuvRxWZ3ayjp8jzXL/view?usp=share_link) that you will probably find most useful right now
		- You will find this [visual reference to fonts available within an iOS app](http://iosfonts.com) to be useful
			- For example, to get my name to appear with the font shown above, I used this code:
			  ![Screen Shot 2022-11-05 at 7.33.04 AM.png|500](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-05%20at%207.33.04%20AM.png)
		  - Here is [another good reference for different font weights and variations](https://daddycoding.com/2019/12/26/swiftui-text/) that are available.
			  
	- **Option 2:** Freestyle
		- Create a new SwiftUI view and experiment with formatting by referring to SwiftUI Views Quick Start.

### Thread 1, Day 7 - Friday, October 28, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Snippets/Providing Evidence in Your Portfolio\|Portfolio: Providing evidence for learning goals]]
2. [Discussion: Grouping Related Info with Structures](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0c3lUIjNqbjj8K8bGm2SN5eiQ#2a_-_Discussion_-_Grouping_Related_Info_with_Structures)
	- Key takeaways:
		- Use `CapitalCase` when naming structures.
		- Use `camelCase` when naming properties and instances of structures.
		- **DRY**

### Thread 1, Day 5 - Wednesday, October 26, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Name Plate
	- Make a final set of enhancements to your Name Plate sketch – or – keep your existing sketch and start a new one, in another Playground file, with a different visual look and feel.
	- To build and show your increasing mastery of concepts we've recently looked at, aim to use some or all of these techniques:
		- [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Iteration\|iteration]]
		- [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Functions\|functions]]
		- [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Random Numbers\|random numbers]]
		- [[Media/Radial Fill Plan\|a rough plan]]
	- Remember that you can use [colour combination websites](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/) and [[Media/Using the Eyedropper Tool to Obtain Nice Colours\|the eyedropper tool to obtain nice colours]] for your sketches.
		- When choosing a color, the *alpha*  or *opacity* value refers to how transparent the colour will be.
		> [!Tip]
		> Try overlapping two filled figures that use a slightly transparent colour. What happens?
	- Here are some ideas that might be fun to use as inspiration, if you are searching for an idea!
		- To implement these patterns, think of how you might use fills and overlapping shapes.

### Thread 1, Day 4 - Monday, October 24, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Apple Developer Account
	- This account will allow you to [use TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) with the apps you create in class this year.
		- It will also allow you to directly download developer resources, which has some advantages compared to using the Mac App Store.
	- First, please [create an Apple ID](http://appleid.apple.com/) using your LCS email address.
	> [!Tip]
	> When creating your Apple ID, use the school's street address, but your own phone number. The complete address for LCS is:
	> `4391 County Road 29`
	> `Lakefield College School`
	> `Lakefield ON K0L2H0`
	> `Canada`
	- Then, accept the invitation to join the LCS Apple Developer team that you will find in your LCS email inbox.
2. Update Operating System
	- To use the required version of Xcode, your computer must be upgraded to at least macOS Monterey version 12.5.
	- Choose Apple menu  > About This Mac to check what version you currently have.
	- Here is [how to upgrade](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212735), as needed.
	- If you have to do a significant upgrade (e.g.: from macOS 11.x to macOS 12.5+) please wait until this evening, after you have completed your Study tasks, to complete it.
		- Alternatively, if a major upgrade is necessary, you could ask the I.S. support team to upgrade your computer over lunch.
3. Download Xcode
	- You can download the [current version, 14.0.1, here](https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_14.0.1/Xcode_14.0.1.xip).
	- This will require logging in with your Apple Developer ID that we just set up.
	- When the download finishes, you will have a `.xip` file in your Downloads folder.
		- Double-click the `.xip` file to decompress it.
		> [!Tip]
		> It's a very large file – decompressing the `.xip` will take some time.
	- Once the `.xip` file is decompressed, you will see an Xcode application icon.
			- Drag Xcode to your Applications folder.
			- You can then move the `.xip` file to your computer's Trash bin.
4. [Course Outline](https://tinyurl.com/lcscs22-g11-sco)
	- We deferred looking at this last week due to my absences from class for coaching.
	- Let's review now using a *think-pair-share* protocol.
5. Making Plans
	- A look at how a little bit of thought can make completing a radial fill pattern like this pretty straightforward:
	![Screen Shot 2022-10-24 at 8.32.51 AM.png|400](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-24%20at%208.32.51%20AM.png)
	- To begin, we will work in pairs, with groups assigned in a visibly random way.
	- We can find some [nice color combinations here](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/).
6. Make further enhancements to your Name Plate sketch.
	- Use some of the concepts we have just explored - be bold!
	- Here is what I came up with after some experimentation:
	![Screen Shot 2022-10-23 at 2.50.47 PM.png|400](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-23%20at%202.50.47%20PM.png)
		
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] As described in item #2 above, if necessary, upgrade your computer's operating system.
- [ ] As described in item #3 above, please download and install Xcode.
- [ ] Complete your enhancements to [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 1/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task.

### Thread 1, Day 3 - Friday, October 21, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Join [our class on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/class/CA-C0vMdx23).
	- This space is for shared posts you want everyone to see:
	  ![Screen Shot 2022-10-21 at 10.07.58 AM.png|300](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-21%20at%2010.07.58%20AM.png)
	- This space is for private portfolio posts that will only be seen by Mr. Gordon:
	  ![Screen Shot 2022-10-21 at 10.08.02 AM.png|300](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-21%20at%2010.08.02%20AM.png)
2. On [Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/), in the private **Portfolio** space, share your progress to date on the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task.
	- Please attach a screenshot of the visual output and screenshot(s) of the code. 
		- You can use `Command-Shift-3` to capture a screenshot; the file will be saved to your Desktop folder.
	- Then, respond to the two standard reflection prompts:
		i. What did I learn or make progress upon today?
		ii. What do I have questions about / what am I struggling with
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Functions\|Introduction to Functions]]
	- A *function* is a way to *encapsulate* (bundle up) a series of steps that we may want to use again.
		- It can be useful to "return home" between drawing different parts of a sketch with the turtle.
			- This tutorial explains [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Functions\|how to use a function]] to do that.
4. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Iteration\|Introduction to Iteration]]
	- A *loop* is a way to repeat a set of instructions many times.
	- The computer will *iterate* over a set of instructions.
	- With each iteration of the loop, instructions will be run again.
5. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Random Numbers\|Random Numbers]]
	- Random numbers can be used to change the appearance or location of part of a sketch.
6. Make enhancements to your Name Plate sketch.
	- Use some of the concepts we have just explored - be bold!
	- Here is what I came up with after some experimentation:
	![Screen Shot 2022-10-23 at 2.50.47 PM.png|400](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-23%20at%202.50.47%20PM.png)

### Thread 1, Day 2 - Wednesday, October 20, 2022
#### Agenda
1. LCAT
	- Please complete your [daily LCAT check](https://lcat.lcs.on.ca) prior to coming to class.
2. Hardcover graph paper notebooks
	- Gentle reminder: please bring your graph paper notebook to every future class for this course.
3. How to Duplicate and Rename Playgrounds
	- If you want to try out a new idea, or build on some existing code, make a *duplicate* of the Turtle Sketches playground.
		- If you wish to build from existing code – you want your existing code to be in the new playground – choose `Duplicate and Keep Changes`
		- If you just want a new Sketches playground to experiment in – you don't need existing code – choose `Duplicate and Reset`
4. [Programming with Purpose](https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-7DQJbMapI)
	- Yesterday, we looked about how Jordi Bruin solved a small problem – visually translating a menu – with the [Cibo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cibo-visual-menu-translator/id1583992402) app.
	- Sometimes, we can help others with major efforts, like writing an app, but...
		- ... how do we get to that place?
		- ... is that the only way to help others?
	- Please have your black hardcover notebook out while you watch *Programming with Purpose* with the class.
		- As you watch, write down any quotes that speak to you.
		- When you are finished watching, summarize a bit – what is *one* takeaway that you have from this video?
5. Continue working on the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task.
	- Here is a [short code excerpt](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/russellgordon/88855e828bf8d44be5dac769f5bfc0a2/raw/dbea4fbe4e97679b754d80f049ff3373bbc557e5/main.swift) that illustrates a few techniques you may find useful.
		- To try this code out, you could [[Media/Trying Out a Code Example\|duplicate your existing playground, then copy and paste in this code]].
	- Remember, you can [[Media/Stepping Through Your Code\|step through your code]] to see what line of code produces what visual result.
	- Sometimes we encounter a *logical error*, which is when the computer does not do what we intended.
		- We can ["debug" the problem](https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlN1GmxSXkc) by checking the position of the turtle using the `drawSelf()` command.
	- You can get nicer colours by [[Media/Using the Colour Well\|using the colour well]].
	- Aim to complete the Name Plate task today. 💪🏼
		- If you are already finished drawing your name, could you enhance it?
			- Change to bubble letters?
			- Add colour?
			- Add a drawing of one of your favourite things or something that speaks to your personality?
	
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Complete the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task.

#### Agenda
1. [Welcome to Computer Studies at LCS](https://www.youtube.com/embed/eX45ubvSW8E)
	- I look forward to meeting you in person tomorrow – until then, here is a welcome by video and a bit about the approach we'll take in this class.
	- We will review the [course outline](https://tinyurl.com/lcscs22-g11-sco) together later this week (though if you wish, you can review it today).
2. Install the [[Software Setup/Playgrounds\|Playgrounds app]].
	- Oliver, Justin, Tom – if you could help others out as needed with this step and the next one – that would be much appreciated.
3. Download the [Sketches Template](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/030Bsp7EIEhY1TnLkzuz9v76w#Turtle_Sketches_Template_v4-1).
	- Here is a [[Media/Installing Turtle Sketches Template\|short animation showing how to add the Sketches Template]] to the Playgrounds app.
> [!NOTE]
> Depending on what version of macOS you currently have installed on your computer, you *may* need to upgrade macOS (and then the Playgrounds app again) before you can try out this playground.
> If that is the case for your computer, please work with a friend today on their computer, and I will help you with your computer in our next class.
4. Start the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task. 
	- This is a warmup task to "get your feet wet" with programming – we will soon move on to writing more sophisticated programs.
	- Here is a [short code excerpt](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/russellgordon/88855e828bf8d44be5dac769f5bfc0a2/raw/dbea4fbe4e97679b754d80f049ff3373bbc557e5/main.swift) that illustrates a few techniques you may find useful.
		- To try this code out, you could [[Media/Trying Out a Code Example\|duplicate your existing playground, then copy and paste in this code]].
	- You can [[Media/Stepping Through Your Code\|step through your code]] to see what line of code produces what visual result.
