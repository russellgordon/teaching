### Thread 2, Day 14 - Thursday, February 2, 2023

#### Agenda

1. **Finding Square Roots**
	- You can [review the history of commits for this project](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SquareRootExample/commits/main) to understand the simplest possible flow for handling user input that is expected to be numeric.
	  ![Screenshot 2023-02-04 at 12.00.44 PM.png|200](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202023-02-04%20at%2012.00.44%20PM.png)
	- We must [take a `String`](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SquareRootExample/blob/3ceda8db37afa243b7bc7dce476e83f95dee1e80/SquareRootExample/Views/CalculationView.swift#L15), [convert it to an optional `Double`](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SquareRootExample/blob/3ceda8db37afa243b7bc7dce476e83f95dee1e80/SquareRootExample/Views/CalculationView.swift#L21-L31), then [unwrap the optional to a regular `Double` so we can do arithmetic](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SquareRootExample/blob/3ceda8db37afa243b7bc7dce476e83f95dee1e80/SquareRootExample/Views/CalculationView.swift#L37-L42) with the value, and [finally, produce `String` output](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SquareRootExample/blob/3ceda8db37afa243b7bc7dce476e83f95dee1e80/SquareRootExample/Views/CalculationView.swift#L48-L50) again:
		```mermaid
		flowchart LR
		
		id1["Step 1\nString"] --> id2["Step 2\nDouble?"]
		id2 --> id3["Step 3\nDouble"]
		id3 --> id4["Step 4\nString"]
		```
2. **Share the Bill:** Opportunities for Further Abstraction
	- A complete example that ties together all concepts we have learned so far in this module
		- Optionally, you can review how it was built, [step by step](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ShareTheBill/commits/main)
		- In the list of commits, click the commit details badge to see what changed within [that specific commit](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ShareTheBill/commit/678934e4a982a17d1bced0139ac69aca02d20895):
		  ![Screenshot 2023-02-02 at 12.53.52 PM.png|650](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202023-02-02%20at%2012.53.52%20PM.png)
	- Please [fork and clone the repository for this app now](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ShareTheBill)
		- With a partner, review the code within the `body` property
			- What opportunities for eliminating repetitive code do you see?
			- Let's improve this now...
			> [!NOTE]
			> We skipped this conversation in class due to time constraints, but here is a [video addressing how to apply abstraction to eliminate repetitive code](https://youtu.be/32h66muzU4Q). This was recorded in the other section of Grade 11 Intro to Computer Science.
2. **Share the Bill:** Add a Second Tab to Show History
	- Data to be saved within an app should be created in one location only
		- Put another way, a given piece of data must have just one *single source of truth*
		- Currently this occurs with the `@State` property wrapper
		- How, though, can we share data between screens?
		- That is where the `@Binding` property wrapper is useful
			- In brief:
				```mermaid
				flowchart TD
				
				id1["App Entry Point\n@State"] --> id2["Screen 1\n@Binding"]
				id1 --> id3["Screen 2\n@Binding"]
				```
			- Let's examine this together now...
			> [!NOTE]
			> Here is the [short video summarizing this ‚Äì how to use @Binding to share data between screens](https://youtu.be/9q_AMRCr5dA). This was recorded in the other section of Grade 11 Intro to Computer Science.
3. **End-of-module Task**: [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Tasks/Make an Interactive App\|Make an Interactive App]]
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*

#### Agenda

1. [Guessing Game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/115TicwDBnw2_fh8voV2w8QAoHkn2tvrh/view?usp=share_link)
	- Working in pairs today... you may select partner... *Driver-Navigator* pattern.
	- Have a look at [this partial recap of operators, and introduction to *selection statements*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WkbUxvZP6OyHjh5JU8LK-TreGBTgv7DB/view?usp=share_link)
	- See if your group can make use of a slider, a button, and a selection statement to implement a "guessing game"
		- The game should work [[Media/Guessing Game\|as shown in this short animation]]
		- Before you start coding, try to explain the logic in writing, in sentence form, on a whiteboard... *then* open Xcode... and make a new project named `GuessingGame`.
		- Commit and push work regularly.
		- Here is [a bit of code to get things started](https://gist.github.com/lcs-rgordon/2efcb3b3be23ef3c07f86aa3d2f105e6)... it is deliberately incomplete... copy this into the project that was created... see if your group can fill in what's missing to complete the game. 
		- Once implemented using a slider for input, *then* try changing it to accept text-based input from the user.
		  
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*

### Thread 2, Day 11 - Monday, January 30, 2023

#### Agenda

1. Mid-module Portfolio Reviews
	- An informal check-in on your progress with:
		- Building user interfaces
		- Applying abstraction to eliminate repetitive code
		- Understanding how to use lists / arrays
		- Writing apps that accept input, process it, and produce output
	
2. Optionals
	- You already understand how to use typical data types such as `Int`, `Double`, `String`, and `Bool`
	- You have built applications that accept user input as a `Double` via the `Slider` structure in SwiftUI
		- Sliders prevent the user from providing invalid input
			- This is *very* helpful
			- However, it can be hard to select a precise value
		- Sometimes, it would be preferable to accept typed input from the user
			- But what happens when invalid input is received from a user?
			- For example, we might expect numeric input, but the user could type `fifty` rather than `50`
		- This is when the notion of an *optional* data type becomes useful
	- Please [fork and clone this project](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/Optionals)
		- Using your black notebook, try each page of the playground
		- Take your time ‚Äì *read for understanding* ‚Äì write down your responses to the questions posed in your black book
		- When you are done ‚Äì *summarize* in writing what you have learned in your [Spaces post](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) for today ‚Äì as well as any questions you have
			- ==Be sure to include several screenshots== showing your progress as you completed the playground
	  
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Complete the first two items described above.
- [ ] Optionally, attempt the third.

### Thread 1, Day 13 - Wednesday, November 9, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [SF Symbols App](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)
	- Not all software developers have graphic design skills.
	- Platform owners like Apple want their users to have a consistent experience when using apps written by different people.
	- One of the ways Apple helps their developers provide that consistent look and feel is by offering a wide variety of built-in images that can be used in apps.
	- Please [download and install](https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/design/resources/download/SF-Symbols-4.dmg) the SF Symbols app now.
2. [Views and Controls App](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ViewsAndControls)
	- This Xcode project includes examples of how to use many common user interface elements that are present in iOS apps.
	- Please [go to the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ViewsAndControls) and then [[Media/Cloning Views and Controls Project\|clone a copy to use]] for future reference.
	- Here is a brief example of [[Media/Using Views and Controls Project\|how to use the project to review examples]].
3. SwiftUI: [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Topics/SwiftUI/Reproducing the Digital Stopwatch Interface, Part 1\|Reproducing the Stopwatch App]]
	- In this tutorial, learn how to apply some concepts we've already learned, as well as a few new ones, to build the user interface for a professional app.
	  
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Finish the tutorial to reproduce the Stopwatch user interface

### Thread 1, Day 12 - Monday, November 7, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [Learning Skills Self-Assessment](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/00b26u1fleLzktdRsJ-nWhS_Q#Learning_Skills_Self-Assessment)
	- Last week you completed in-person interviews with Mr. Gordon to discuss your achievement to date.
	- You set goals for improvement over the next two weeks to complete this module.
	- *Learning skills* drive achievement.
		- That is, if you have strong learning skills, the rest often takes care of itself.
	- Please self-evaluate your learning skills for this course to date.
		- When completed, take a photo of your self-assessment and please post it [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) in the *private* portfolio space.
2. [Source Control: Quick reference](https://www.russellgordon.ca/cs/source-control/introduction/using-source-control.pdf)
	- From last week's class, please glue this inside the front cover of your black hardcover notebook.
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Topics/SwiftUI/Composition of Views Using Custom Structures\|SwiftUI: Composition of Views Using Custom Structures]]
	- Remember **D.R.Y.** ?
		- *Don't repeat yourself.*
	- We can write our own structures that conform to the `View` protocol.
		- These custom structures build upon the structures like `VStack`, `HStack`, `ScrollView`, et cetera that are provided by Apple through the SwiftUI framework.
		- By using custom structures, we avoid having to make repetitive changes to our code.
		- As well, the overall number of lines of code that it takes to write an app is much lower.
4. Exercise: Improving the List View in **FavouriteThings**
	- Currently, the list view looks like this:
	  ![Screen Shot 2022-11-06 at 11.05.42 AM.png|200](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-06%20at%2011.05.42%20AM.png)
	- `NavigationLink` labels can show *any* view, not just a `Text` view.
	- Using your new knowledge from yesterday's class about how to combine `VStack` and `HStack` structures, and from today's class about how to create a new custom structure, modify your project so that the list view looks like this instead:	  
	  ![Screen Shot 2022-11-06 at 11.03.53 AM.png|200](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-06%20at%2011.03.53%20AM.png)
	> [!HINT]
	> To re-use existing images in your app and show a smaller square thumbnail, the view modifiers shown here will do the trick:
	> ![Screen Shot 2022-11-06 at 11.11.14 AM.png|400](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-06%20at%2011.11.14%20AM.png)

			- To access the file, you need to be logged in to your LCS Google account
			- You may wish to download that PDF file directly to your computer for use in the future
				- To download the PDF file, look for this icon in the top-right corner of your browser  window: 
				![Screen Shot 2022-11-05 at 6.25.51 AM.png|600](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-05%20at%206.25.51%20AM.png)
		- Other books Mark authored are also excellent, but are not provided free of charge
			- These books cover more advanced topics that you may choose to use later this year or in the grade 12 computer science course
2. SwiftUI: Basic Concepts and Terms
	- From the [SwiftUI Views Quick Start](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19q9TiI0C3TJW7SGUavhA0sezGZceDNBH/view?usp=share_link) book, please read through the *Basic Concepts* section from pages 12 to 20 in the PDF file
		- This will only take you a few minutes
1. SwiftUI: Understanding Mark's `HeaderView`
	- When you see code it's important that how it works is not a mystery to you
		- Mark includes the same standard layout at the start of all his code examples and screenshots
		- This layout is created from a SwiftUI view named `HeaderView`
		- To understand how `HeaderView` works, please review the *My Template* section from [pages 31 to 39 of the Swift UI Views Quick Start](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19q9TiI0C3TJW7SGUavhA0sezGZceDNBH/view?usp=share_link)
		- This is a good initial example of how to do basic formatting in SwiftUI
		- ==It is often easier to learn by trying things out as you go.==
			- So, you are asked to:
				- [create a new project in Xcode, of type iOS App, named **HeaderExample**](https://www.youtube.com/embed/z5pwFrmgcNk)
				- then, as you read pages 31 to 39, try typing in the code Mark provides within the `body` property in his examples
2. Exercise: Experiment with SwiftUI Layouts
	- **Option 1:** Extend Name Badge
		- Go back to the Name Badge project we started in a prior class.
		- Make the view's visual appearance look like this:
		  ![Screen Shot 2022-11-05 at 7.08.34 AM.png|300](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-05%20at%207.08.34%20AM.png)
		- If you wish, use the complete [SwiftUI Views Quick Start book](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19q9TiI0C3TJW7SGUavhA0sezGZceDNBH/view?usp=share_link) as a reference, or, refer to [this PDF that contains a subset of concepts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KowxWGeBQGdbW6PtuvRxWZ3ayjp8jzXL/view?usp=share_link) that you will probably find most useful right now
		- You will find this [visual reference to fonts available within an iOS app](http://iosfonts.com) to be useful
			- For example, to get my name to appear with the font shown above, I used this code:
			  ![Screen Shot 2022-11-05 at 7.33.04 AM.png|500](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-05%20at%207.33.04%20AM.png)
		  - Here is [another good reference for different font weights and variations](https://daddycoding.com/2019/12/26/swiftui-text/) that are available.
			  
	- **Option 2:** Freestyle
		- Create a new SwiftUI view and experiment with formatting by referring to SwiftUI Views Quick Start.

### Thread 1, Day 5 - Wednesday, October 26, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Name Plate
	- Make a final set of enhancements to your Name Plate sketch ‚Äì¬†or ‚Äì¬†keep your existing sketch and start a new one, in another Playground file, with a different visual look and feel.
	- To build and show your increasing mastery of concepts we've recently looked at, aim to use some or all of these techniques:
		- [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Iteration\|iteration]]
		- [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Functions\|functions]]
		- [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Random Numbers\|random numbers]]
		- [[Media/Radial Fill Plan\|a rough plan]]
	- Remember that you can use [colour combination websites](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/) and [[Media/Using the Eyedropper Tool to Obtain Nice Colours\|the eyedropper tool to obtain nice colours]] for your sketches.
		- When choosing a color, the *alpha*  or *opacity* value refers to how transparent the colour will be.
		> [!Tip]
		> Try overlapping two filled figures that use a slightly transparent colour. What happens?
	- Here are some ideas that might be fun to use as inspiration, if you are searching for an idea!
		- To implement these patterns, think of how you might use fills and overlapping shapes.

### Thread 1, Day 4 - Monday, October 24, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Apple Developer Account
	- This account will allow you to [use TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) with the apps you create in class this year.
		- It will also allow you to directly download developer resources, which has some advantages compared to using the Mac App Store.
	- First, please [create an Apple ID](http://appleid.apple.com/) using your LCS email address.
	> [!Tip]
	> When creating your Apple ID, use the school's street address, but your own phone number. The complete address for LCS is:
	> `4391 County Road 29`
	> `Lakefield College School`
	> `Lakefield ON K0L2H0`
	> `Canada`
	- Then, accept the invitation to join the LCS Apple Developer team that you will find in your LCS email inbox.
2. Update Operating System
	- To use the required version of Xcode, your computer must be upgraded to at least macOS Monterey version 12.5.
	- Choose Apple menu¬†Ô£ø > About This Mac to check what version you currently have.
	- Here is [how to upgrade](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212735), as needed.
	- If you have to do a significant upgrade (e.g.: from macOS 11.x to macOS 12.5+) please wait until this evening, after you have completed your Study tasks, to complete it.
		- Alternatively, if a major upgrade is necessary, you could ask the I.S. support team to upgrade your computer over lunch.
3. Download Xcode
	- You can download the [current version, 14.0.1, here](https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_14.0.1/Xcode_14.0.1.xip).
	- This will require logging in with your Apple Developer ID that we just set up.
	- When the download finishes, you will have a `.xip` file in your Downloads folder.
		- Double-click the `.xip` file to decompress it.
		> [!Tip]
		> It's a very large file ‚Äì decompressing the `.xip` will take some time.
	- Once the `.xip` file is decompressed, you will see an Xcode application icon.
			- Drag Xcode to your Applications folder.
			- You can then move the `.xip` file to your computer's Trash bin.
4. [Course Outline](https://tinyurl.com/lcscs22-g11-sco)
	- We deferred looking at this last week due to my absences from class for coaching.
	- Let's review now using a *think-pair-share* protocol.
5. Making Plans
	- A look at how a little bit of thought can make completing a radial fill pattern like this pretty straightforward:
	![Screen Shot 2022-10-24 at 8.32.51 AM.png|400](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-24%20at%208.32.51%20AM.png)
	- To begin, we will work in pairs, with groups assigned in a visibly random way.
	- We can find some [nice color combinations here](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/).
6. Make further enhancements to your Name Plate sketch.
	- Use some of the concepts we have just explored - be bold!
	- Here is what I came up with after some experimentation:
	![Screen Shot 2022-10-23 at 2.50.47 PM.png|400](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-23%20at%202.50.47%20PM.png)
		
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] As described in item #2 above, if necessary, upgrade your computer's operating system.
- [ ] As described in item #3 above, please download and install Xcode.
- [ ] Complete your enhancements to [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 1/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task.

### Thread 1, Day 3 - Friday, October 21, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Join [our class on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/class/CA-C0vMdx23).
	- This space is for shared posts you want everyone to see:
	  ![Screen Shot 2022-10-21 at 10.07.58 AM.png|300](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-21%20at%2010.07.58%20AM.png)
	- This space is for private portfolio posts that will only be seen by Mr. Gordon:

2. On [Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/), in the private **Portfolio** space, share your progress to date on the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task.
	- Please attach a screenshot of the visual output and screenshot(s) of the code. 
		- You can use `Command-Shift-3` to capture a screenshot; the file will be saved to your Desktop folder.
	- Then, respond to the two standard reflection prompts:
		i. What did I learn or make progress upon today?
		ii. What do I have questions about / what am I struggling with
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Functions\|Introduction to Functions]]
	- A *function* is a way to *encapsulate* (bundle up) a series of steps that we may want to use again.
		- It can be useful to "return home" between drawing different parts of a sketch with the turtle.
			- This tutorial explains [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Functions\|how to use a function]] to do that.
4. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Iteration\|Introduction to Iteration]]
	- A *loop* is a way to repeat a set of instructions many times.
	- The computer will *iterate* over a set of instructions.
	- With each iteration of the loop, instructions will be run again.
5. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Concepts/Random Numbers\|Random Numbers]]
	- Random numbers can be used to change the appearance or location of part of a sketch.
6. Make enhancements to your Name Plate sketch.
	- Use some of the concepts we have just explored - be bold!
	- Here is what I came up with after some experimentation:

	- You can find some [nice color combinations here](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/).
	
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Complete your enhancements to [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task.
- [ ] Please share your progress on [Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/).

### Thread 1, Day 2 - Wednesday, October 20, 2022
#### Agenda
1. LCAT
	- Please complete your [daily LCAT check](https://lcat.lcs.on.ca) prior to coming to class.
2. Hardcover graph paper notebooks
	- Gentle reminder: please bring your graph paper notebook to every future class for this course.
3. How to Duplicate and Rename Playgrounds
	- If you want to try out a new idea, or build on some existing code, make a *duplicate* of the Turtle Sketches playground.
		- If you wish to build from existing code ‚Äì you want your existing code to be in the new playground ‚Äì¬†choose `Duplicate and Keep Changes`
		- If you just want a new Sketches playground to experiment in ‚Äì you don't need existing code ‚Äì¬†choose `Duplicate and Reset`
4. [Programming with Purpose](https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-7DQJbMapI)
	- Yesterday, we looked about how Jordi Bruin solved a small problem ‚Äì visually translating a menu ‚Äì¬†with the [Cibo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cibo-visual-menu-translator/id1583992402) app.
	- Sometimes, we can help others with major efforts, like writing an app, but...
		- ... how do we get to that place?
		- ... is that the only way to help others?
	- Please have your black hardcover notebook out while you watch *Programming with Purpose* with the class.
		- As you watch, write down any quotes that speak to you.
		- When you are finished watching, summarize a bit ‚Äì what is *one* takeaway that you have from this video?
5. Continue working on the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task.
	- Here is a [short code excerpt](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/russellgordon/88855e828bf8d44be5dac769f5bfc0a2/raw/dbea4fbe4e97679b754d80f049ff3373bbc557e5/main.swift) that illustrates a few techniques you may find useful.
		- To try this code out, you could [[Media/Trying Out a Code Example\|duplicate your existing playground, then copy and paste in this code]].
	- Remember, you can [[Media/Stepping Through Your Code\|step through your code]] to see what line of code produces what visual result.
	- Sometimes we encounter a *logical error*, which is when the computer does not do what we intended.
		- We can ["debug" the problem](https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlN1GmxSXkc) by checking the position of the turtle using the `drawSelf()` command.
	- You can get nicer colours by [[Media/Using the Colour Well\|using the colour well]].
	- Aim to complete the Name Plate task today. üí™üèº
		- If you are already finished drawing your name, could you enhance it?
			- Change to bubble letters?
			- Add colour?
			- Add a drawing of one of your favourite things or something that speaks to your personality?
	
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Complete the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task.

### Thread 1, Day 1 - Wednesday, October 19, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [Welcome to Computer Studies at LCS](https://www.youtube.com/embed/eX45ubvSW8E)
	- I look forward to meeting you in person tomorrow ‚Äì until then, here is a welcome by video and a bit about the approach we'll take in this class.
	- We will review the [course outline](https://tinyurl.com/lcscs22-g11-sco) together later this week (though if you wish, you can review it today).
2. Install the [[Software Setup/Playgrounds\|Playgrounds app]].
	- Oliver, Justin, Tom ‚Äì if you could help others out as needed with this step and the next one ‚Äì that would be much appreciated.
3. Download the [Sketches Template](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/030Bsp7EIEhY1TnLkzuz9v76w#Turtle_Sketches_Template_v4-1).
	- Here is a [[Media/Installing Turtle Sketches Template\|short animation showing how to add the Sketches Template]] to the Playgrounds app.
> [!NOTE]
> Depending on what version of macOS you currently have installed on your computer, you *may* need to upgrade macOS (and then the Playgrounds app again) before you can try out this playground.
> If that is the case for your computer, please work with a friend today on their computer, and I will help you with your computer in our next class.
4. Start the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate]] task. 
	- This is a warmup task to "get your feet wet" with programming ‚Äì we will soon move on to writing more sophisticated programs.
	- Here is a [short code excerpt](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/russellgordon/88855e828bf8d44be5dac769f5bfc0a2/raw/dbea4fbe4e97679b754d80f049ff3373bbc557e5/main.swift) that illustrates a few techniques you may find useful.
		- To try this code out, you could [[Media/Trying Out a Code Example\|duplicate your existing playground, then copy and paste in this code]].
	- You can [[Media/Stepping Through Your Code\|step through your code]] to see what line of code produces what visual result.
	- Sometimes we encounter a *logical error*, which is when the computer does not do what we intended.
