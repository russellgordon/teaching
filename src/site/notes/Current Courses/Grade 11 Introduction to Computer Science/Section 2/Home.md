#### Agenda

1. Working period for [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Tasks/The Culminating Task\|the Culminating Task]]
	- Aim to complete coding for your app tonight.
	- If you are writing an app that involves data being categorized and stored within a database, this [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Topics/Databases/Grouping and Sorting Data\|one final optional tutorial on how to sort and group data may be useful]].
	- Depending on your app, remember that you can still meet requirements for the culminating task even if you have not implemented all of your original goals â€“ chat with Mr. Gordon if you are not sure.
	- When stuck, use your ðŸ¦†, use each other for help, use Mr. Gordon, or take a break.
	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> Use of machine learning assistants (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and similar software) is not permitted for any part the culminating task. The express purpose of the culminating task is to demonstrate your understanding of concepts and vocabulary learned this year in the course. Use of a machine learning assistant or other "AI" software will be considered an academic honesty violation and [handled as described in the School Life Guide](https://lcs.myschoolapp.com/ftpimages/108/download/download_4338056.pdf#page=58).
