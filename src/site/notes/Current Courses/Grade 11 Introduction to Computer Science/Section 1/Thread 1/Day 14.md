#### Agenda

1. [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
	- Programming can be hard, both for beginners and experienced software developers.
	- If you are running into syntax errors or logical errors and perhaps getting frustrated: that is normal!
	- Pairing with a friend to describe what you are trying to do with your code, line by line, can be helpful.
		- Often during this process, you will realize the source of the problem you are having.
	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! ðŸ¦†
2. [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Tasks/Reproduce an Interface|Task: Reproduce an Interface]]
	- Show your understanding of recent lessons by reproducing a user interface of your choice.
