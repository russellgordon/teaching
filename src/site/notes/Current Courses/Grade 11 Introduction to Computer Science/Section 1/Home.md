### Thread 1, Day 13 - Tuesday, November 15, 2022

> [!NOTE]
> This post is provided in advance, so that if you choose to, you can work ahead over the November long weekend on the third item of this agenda. You can optionally complete items one and two before starting item three.

#### Agenda
1. [SF Symbols App](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/)
	- Not all software developers have graphic design skills.
	- Platform owners like Apple want their users to have a consistent experience when using apps written by different people.
	- One of the ways Apple helps their developers provide that consistent look and feel is by offering a wide variety of built-in images that can be used in apps.
	- Please [download and install](https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/design/resources/download/SF-Symbols-4.dmg) the SF Symbols app now.
2. [ Views and Controls App](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ViewsAndControls)
	- This Xcode project includes examples of how to use many common user interface elements that are present in iOS apps.
	- Please [go to the repository on GitHub](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ViewsAndControls) and then [[Media/Cloning Views and Controls Project|clone a copy to use]] for future reference.
	- Here is a brief example of [[Media/Using Views and Controls Project|how to use the project to review examples]].
3. SwiftUI: [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Topics/SwiftUI/Reproducing the Digital Stopwatch Interface, Part 1|Reproducing the Stopwatch App]]
	- In this tutorial, learn how to apply some concepts we've already learned, as well as a few new ones, to build the user interface for a professional app.
	  
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Finish the tutorial to reproduce the Stopwatch user interface
