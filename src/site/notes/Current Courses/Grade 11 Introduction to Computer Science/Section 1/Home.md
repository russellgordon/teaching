### Thread 4, Day 8 - Monday, June 5, 2023

#### Agenda

1. The Week Ahead
	- A brief [[Media/Final Week for ICS3U1 in 2023\|glance at the calendar]] to understand available time.
2. Understanding the Written Portion of the Culminating Task
	- Please make a [copy of the template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13pJG5xbVTNL7oKOUhn7ibT8Qd6Xom78N6pCrg8aw_uk/copy) now.
		- Share the template with Mr. Gordon with Editor permissions.
	- Please [open the exemplar for step 8](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pgtIn0XU3OyKCtqpzjV3gP4nveEP__K_/view).
		- We will engage in a think-pair-share protocol to build understanding of the questions and example responses.
3. Working period for [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Tasks/The Culminating Task\|the Culminating Task]]
	- You should be well into coding your app.
	> [!TIP]
	> A gentle reminder â€“ don't forget about [[Media/Requirement 6\|step #6]]Â regarding logical errors and syntax errors. Here's [an example post](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZVAj0o9l-LiVToJ2yyVgO6CrranTVuie/view).
	- Are you authoring an app that writes to a database? Allows the user to categorize data? Something [[Media/Categorizing Data in the Favourite Movies App\|like this]]?
		- If so, the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Recaps/Thread 3 - Modeling Data#1 â€“ Databases\|thread 3 recap on databases]] to build Favourite Movies, and the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Topics/Databases/Designing a Database with Relational Data\|extension tutorial on how to design database tables to be joined]], will be helpful.
	- When stuck, use your ðŸ¦†, use each other for help, use Mr. Gordon, or take a break.
	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> Use of machine learning assistants (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, and similar software) is not permitted for any part the culminating task. The express purpose of the culminating task is to demonstrate your understanding of concepts and vocabulary learned this year in the course. Use of a machine learning assistant or other "AI" software will be considered an academic honesty violation and [handled as described in the School Life Guide](https://lcs.myschoolapp.com/ftpimages/108/download/download_4338056.pdf#page=58).
	
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Continue making progress on [the culminating task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FcuQ33zGVQgGnEi4tEz-kbtQWrdZOgp0/view?usp=share_link).
	- Aim to have your code complete **by the end of day Wednesday**.
	- That means you would have in-class time on Thursday and Friday to complete [[Media/Requirement 8\|step 8]] of the [culminating task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FcuQ33zGVQgGnEi4tEz-kbtQWrdZOgp0/view?usp=share_link).
		- As mentioned last week, writing for requirement 8 must be done during class time.
