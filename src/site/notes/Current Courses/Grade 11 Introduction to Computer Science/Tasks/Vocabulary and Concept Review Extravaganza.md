# Vocabulary and Concept Review Extravaganza

## Instructions

- Work in groups of two – please find a partner.
	- Mr. Gordon will display a list of key terms and list of key questions.
	- write the term / question **and** a legible answer clearly on the card stock provided
- Bring your responses to Mr. Gordon for approval, then tape correct responses on the whiteboard
	- If your answer is correct, and:
		- computers were closed and phones were put away while you worked, earn **4 chips**
		- a computer was open and you referred to materials from [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 2/All Prior Classes\|our class website only]], earn **2 chips**
	- At the end of the extravaganza, the group with the *most* chips gets to select first from the **Paper Bags of Possibility**™️, the group with the *second-most* chips gets to select second, and so on... once all bags have been selected, they can be opened.

## Cautions

- If your group provides an incorrect answer:
	- lose **half your group's entire pile of chips**
- Also:
	- you may work with another group to check or further improve an answer, but then **you must share half the chips you are awarded with that group**
	- if an incorrect answer is provided by two groups who collaborated, **each group loses one-quarter of their entire pile of chips**
	- only one computer open per group, please
	
> [!NOTE]
> Groups observed using unauthorized reference materials (e.g.: search engines, AI chatbots, et cetera) will **lose half of their group's pile of chips**.
