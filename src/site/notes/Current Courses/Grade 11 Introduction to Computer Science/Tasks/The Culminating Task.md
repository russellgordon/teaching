Stuck for an idea? Review [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Snippets/App Ideas\|this list of possibilities]]. ==Remember==, every student must make a different app. ==Before you begin== the culminating task, Mr. Gordon must approve your goal.

Main advice? **Don't delay.** Use time wisely. 

**Everything will take longer than you expect it to.**
