## Why are we here?

Masako Wakamiya [learned to code at 81 years old](https://www.youtube.com/embed/UFYJ2DE9wlM).

[Personal Voice for iOS](https://www.fastcompany.com/90896931/apple-iphone-personal-voice-als-voice-banking) is coming later this year.

*Why are we here?*

We are here to write apps that help others by solving problems.

## The 2-2-2 method

We started the course looking at [how Jordi Bruin developed Cibo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RkY9vs3dfZLlB20VlV-_8-hnWoZKyLrU/view?usp=share_link), the visual menu translator app.

What is the 2-2-2 method? Here is how [Jordi](https://bento.me/jordi) describes it:

> **The basic idea is that I need to be able to make the first version of my idea in under 2 hours.** This version is only meant to be used by me, so it can include hardcoded values, an ugly design, decisions that are sub-optimal etc. The goal of this phase is to test out the idea and determine if it's useful. 
>  
> **The next version should take no more than 2 days to build, and this version is something you can share with friends and other people you trust.** No more hard coded data, it should work for them without issue. There might still be clear instructions that you have to tell them as they use the app. You'll get a lot of feedback on how the app operates, which informs what you need to add / remove before launch.
>  
> **Then you take the next 2 weeks to release the app.** The limited time forces you to keep the app small and focus on your main differentiating features. Remove anything that would make it hard to finish in 2 weeks, because you can add those things back later.

When we start the culminating task at the end of this week, know that you will essentially be following Jordi's 2-2-2 method.

You *can* release an app in a short period of time!

## Final Portfolio Reviews

Your portfolio will be reviewed by Mr. Gordon at the start of next week, one last time, to set your grade for the "term" or year.

Everything you do between now and ==**Sunday at 11 PM**== should be added to your portfolio to better make the case for your understanding of the big ideas of this course:

- **Thread 1: User Interfaces**
	- How do we build interfaces using structures, SwiftUI, and by applying abstraction?
- **Thread 2: Interactive Apps**
	- How do we take input, perform computations, and produce output?
	- How can lists help us to do that?
- **Thread 3: Modeling Data**
	- How can we store and retrieve data from a database?
	- How can we retrieve data from online sources?

This week you will have a selection of tutorials and exercises that you can choose to complete that review these big ideas.

As you do so, add to your portfolio – this must be completed prior to ==**Sunday at 11 PM**==.

When you write in your portfolio, clearly identify what new techniques you learned.

You must create a new project for each task.

Use source control – **==commit frequently.==**

## Day 1: User Interfaces

### Resources

While search and other tools are useful, a good reference is *really* useful.

Be certain you've downloaded [SwiftUI Views Quick Start](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19q9TiI0C3TJW7SGUavhA0sezGZceDNBH/view?usp=share_link).

Here is a nice tutorial on how to [display content in a fixed grid](https://sarunw.com/posts/swiftui-grid/). 

Here is a tutorial explaining [how to build a flexible, scrolling grid](https://sarunw.com/posts/swiftui-lazyvgrid-lazyhgrid/).

Here is a [visual reference to the built-in fonts in iOS](http://iosfonts.com/).

Here is a visual reference to [font weights and variations](https://daddycoding.com/2019/12/26/swiftui-text/).

Here is the [Views and Controls reference app](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ViewsAndControls) that shows you how to the most common user interface elements within an app. 

Use [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/) to access commonly used icons. Here is an article that reviews [how to use SF Symbols and access multi-color symbols](https://www.avanderlee.com/swift/sf-symbols-guide/).

Finally, you may find the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Recaps/Thread 1 - Structures\|overall concept recap for module 1 to be a helpful summary]].

### Exercises

#### A – Build a Static Layout

Build a static layout and *apply abstraction*.

Select a screen from an app in the list below, or show Mr. Gordon a proposal for something else...

#### B – Learn How to Use Charts

If you are up for a challenge, [Swift Charts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/charts) is a great framework that makes it relatively straightforward to build a variety of dadta visualizations into your app.

Here is a [great introduction to using Swift Charts](https://www.kodeco.com/36025169-swift-charts-tutorial-getting-started); this could be completed and added to your portfolio as evidence under the Knowledge evaluation category.

## Day 2: Interactive Apps

### Recap

Here is a [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Recaps/Thread 2 - Interactive Apps\|recap or summary of the big ideas introduced in thread 2]] that is recommended reading before proceeding.

### Exercise

#### Extend Math Maven

[Math Maven](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/MathMaven) is an app that is designed to help elementary school students improve at arithmetic – addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Fork and clone Math Maven, then complete one or more of the following extensions to review concepts from thread 2 of this course:

- complete the Multiplication screen
- complete the Division screen
- add [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Tutorials/AirBnB Lottie Animations Library\|animations]] that vary depending on whether an answer was correct or not
- looks for ways to apply abstraction (add more helper views)

> [!TIP]
> Here is [a video where this exercise was introduced](https://www.youtube.com/embed/raGKKZjigk4) to one of the sections of Grade 11 Intro to Computer Science. It may be helpful to understand how to get started.
