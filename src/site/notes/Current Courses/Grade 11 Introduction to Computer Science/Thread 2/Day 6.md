4. Task: Geometric Figures, Extended
	- Revisit the [[Current Courses/Grade 11 Introduction to Computer Science/Section 1/Tasks/Geometric Figures\|Geometric Figures task]]
	- For your assigned shape, add to Area and Perimeter app that you started in our prior class, so that it:
		- allows for navigation between the existing screen for a rectangle and the new screen that you will write for your previously assigned shape
		- accepts slider-based input for the dimensions of your shape or figure
		- shows output for the perimeter and area or surface area and volume
		- additionally, work on polishing the user interface so that it is more functional and appealing
