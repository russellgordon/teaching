### Thread 2, Day 5 - Thursday, January 19, 2023

#### Agenda

1. Lesson: Interactive Applications Using Sliders
	- **Input-Process-Output**
		- Writing applications that accept input, process it, and display output.
		- We will write an app that calculates the area of a square or rectangle.
		- Here are the instructions from class, in order... each video is quite short:
			- [1 - Creating the Project](https://youtu.be/bDS5aO_zSkc)
			- [2 - Organizing the Project with a New View](https://youtu.be/6S4Qoffmdxk)
			- [3 - Create a Static Layout.](https://youtu.be/XuDLSzjDybQ)
			- [4 - Add Properties to Begin Making an Interactive Layout](https://youtu.be/6Kh_ehl9PgU)
			- [5 - Add Sliders To Allow for User Input](https://youtu.be/0sL9UTmB-Ss)
			- [6 - Using the Group Structure to Work Around the Ten View Limit](https://youtu.be/8aJx0YRKjtM)
		- Now, please take the app you have written, and extend it to calculate perimeter as well.
2. Exercise: Temperature Converter
	-  Write an application (from scratch, in a new project) that converts a temperature in Celsius to its equivalent in Fahrenheit.
		- Optionally:
			- Also write a page that calculates the reverse: from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
			- Add navigation to the app so that the user can move between these screens.
	  
#### To-do items
*Before our next class...*
- [ ] Extend your Area and Perimeter app to calculate and display the perimeter of a given rectangle.
- [ ] As described above, write a Temperature Converter app.
- [ ] Share updates [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/).
