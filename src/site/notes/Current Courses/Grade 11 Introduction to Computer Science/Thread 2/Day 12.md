### Thread 2, Day 12 - Thursday, February 2, 2023

#### Agenda

1. Optionals and Data Input
	- Learn how to use optionals to safely handle user input.
	- Please [fork and clone this project](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/OptionalsAndDataInput)
		- Using your black notebook, try each page of the playground
		- Take your time – *read for understanding* – write down your responses to the questions posed in your black book
		- When you are done – *summarize* in writing what you have learned in your [Spaces post](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) for today – as well as any questions you have
			- ==Be sure to include several screenshots== showing your progress as you completed the playground
	
2. Exercise: Convert an Existing Program to Text-based Input
	- Take at least one of your existing programs that calculate area, perimeter, surface area, or volume, and make changes so that rather than sliders, the user can provide input using text fields.
