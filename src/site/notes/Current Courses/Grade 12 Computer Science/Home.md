### Thread 2, Day 10 - Thursday, January 26, 2023
#### Agenda

1. Chicago @ LCS: Ignoring certain files for source control
	- Open the Terminal app on your computer.
	- Then [visit this page](https://www.russellgordon.ca/gitignore-setup.txt).
	- Copy the commands at that page into the Terminal.
	- Restart Xcode.
	- This ensures that files that should not be tracked for source control will not accidentally be committed.
2. Musicals @ LCS: Populating the Normalized Database
	- Dividing up work to populate the database with information for Chicago and Anything Goes.
		- Use [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com) to write the SQL.
		- Refer to the [original database schema diagram](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2022-23/ics4u/normalized-musicals-at-lcs-database-schema.png) or this [alternate version](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2022-23/ics4u/normalized-musicals-at-lcs-database-schema-alternate.png) â€“ whatever you find easier to read.
3. StarCam: Business and Technology Questions
	- Next Monday, Rick and Sarah from StarCam will visit us again in person.
		- By Zoom, the following people will also be joining us:
			- Greg (owner and CEO)
			- David (primary developer)
	- Look for a post from Rick or Sarah in their space [on our Spaces page](https://ca.spacesedu.com/).
		- Please reply with (at least one) question(s) that you have related to technology or business development for StarCam. This will help their team prepare to give us the best possible answers.
		  
			- For example, some questions Mr. Gordon would like to ask:
			  
			  *How does your company track issues to be completed for StarCam?*
			  
			  *How are releases organized and planned within your project management software?*
			  
			  *To what extent does your company use unit tests? Integration testing?*
