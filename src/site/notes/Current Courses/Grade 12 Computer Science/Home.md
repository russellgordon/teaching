### Thread 2, Day 15 - Friday, February 3, 2023
#### Agenda

1. Musicals @ LCS
	- Populating Relationships in the Musicals @ LCS database
		- We have already populated tables without foreign keys â€“ tables whose data does not depend on other tables
		- Today we will establish relationships, for example:
			- **position-production**
				- For what *production* did a given *person* hold a given *position* and what *classification* was that?
				- For *Chicago*, the person *Kate Bemrose* was a *Lead* and she was a *Student*
			- **role**
				- Which person, holding a *position within a production*, had the role for a given *character*?
				- Kate Bemrose, a *Lead*, played the character *Velma Kelly*
			- **character-group**
				- Which *character* was part of which *group*?
				- The character *Liz* was a member of the *Ensemble*.
			- **musical_number-group**
				- What *musical number* did a given *group* sing?
				- The *Cell Block Girls* sang *Cell Block Tango*.
			- **musical_number-character**
				- What *musical number* did a given character sing?
				- *Velma Kelly* sang in *Cell Block Tango*
