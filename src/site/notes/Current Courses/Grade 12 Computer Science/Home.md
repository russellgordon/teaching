### Thread 1, Day 13 - Tuesday, November 15, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Boss
	- As a class, observe while two students play Boss.
2. Pseudo-code for Boss
	- With your partner, write pseudo-code for the game of Boss.
	- In a few minutes, we will share solutions.
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Topics/Algorithms/Recursion|Recursion]]
	- An introduction to recursion
	- Benefits
	- Drawbacks
	- When to use recursion
4. Exercise: Fibonacci sequence
	- In a Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers in the sequence.
	- The first two terms of a Fibonacci sequence have the values `0` and `1`.
		- For example, Fibonacci sequence with ten terms would look like this:
	    `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34`
	- Formally, this can be described as follows:
	  $F_0 = 0$
	  $F_1 = 1$
	  $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$
	- Write a command-line macOS app that prints the terms of Fibonacci sequence.
		- Solve this with two different implementations:
			- a recursive solution
			- a solution using iteration (one or more loops)
