### Thread 1, Day 15 - Friday, November 18, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Drawing Custom Shapes with SwiftUI: A few creations...
	- Share some examples of shapes created 

2. Using Iteration and Recursion to Draw Shapes
	- We will reproduce this image:
	  ![Screen Shot 2022-11-18 at 1.58.24 PM.png|200](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-18%20at%201.58.24%20PM.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can access the code we developed in class [by cloning this repository](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ShrinkingCircles) or simply [browsing the history of commits](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ShrinkingCircles/commits/main).

3. Exercise: Create More Custom Shapes Using Iteration or Recursion
	- Work in at least a pair to create images that employ iteration or recursion.
		- Whether you use iteration or recursion is up to you.
		- Here are two possibilities that would be a good challenge:
			![circles_upon_circles_4.png|300](/img/user/Attachments/circles_upon_circles_4.png)
			![Screen Shot 2022-11-18 at 2.00.51 PM.png|300](/img/user/Attachments/Screen%20Shot%202022-11-18%20at%202.00.51%20PM.png)

> [!TIP]
> When you create your shapes, do not use fixed co-ordinates. Instead, make use of `rect.height`, `rect.maxY`, and other properties of the `CGRect` that is provided to the `path` function, so that your shapes *scale* as the size of the window or device changes.

### Thread 1, Day 14 - Thursday, November 17, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Fibonacci Sequence: A few solutions
	- A discussion of iterative and recursive solutions.
	- You can view Mr. Gordon's [iterative](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/FibonacciSequence/blob/main/FibonacciSequence/main.swift#L10-L42) and [recursive solution](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/FibonacciSequence/blob/main/FibonacciSequence/main.swift#L44-L106), if you wish.

> [!NOTE]
> Mr. Gordon's solutions should not be seen as the only "correct" solution to the exercise given on [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Thread 1/Day 13\|Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Thread 1/Day 13]]. His code prioritizes understandability and readability, which sometimes sacrifices efficiency. All code is always a work in progress, and Mr. Gordon welcomes feedback and discussion about the solutions he shares.

2. Drawing Custom Shapes with SwiftUI
	- Discussed the Shape protocol for a structure and how it requires that [[Media/Shape Protocol and Drawing within a Rectangle\|a path for a shape be defined within the boundaries of a rectangle, or "rect"]].
	- Set up [a project in Xcode to try drawing some shapes](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/CustomShapesExamples).
		- If you missed class or need to get caught up, clone the project given above.
	
3. Exercise: Create Custom Shapes
	- Try creating line drawings of various shapes.
		- For example:
			- An arrow
			- A [[Media/Parabolic Curve Made From Lines\|parabolic curve made from lines]]
	- Create a new structure for each new shape you draw.

> [!TIP]
> When you create your shapes, do not use fixed co-ordinates. Instead, make use of `rect.height`, `rect.maxY`, and other properties of the `CGRect` that is provided to the `path` function, so that your shapes *scale* as the size of the window or device changes.
	
#### To-do items

### Thread 1, Day 13 - Tuesday, November 15, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Boss
	- As a class, observe while two students play Boss.
2. Pseudo-code for Boss
	- With your partner, write pseudo-code for the game of Boss.
	- In a few minutes, we will share solutions.
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Topics/Algorithms/Recursion\|Recursion]]
	- An introduction to recursion
	- Benefits
	- Drawbacks
	- When to use recursion
4. Exercise: Fibonacci sequence
	- In a Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers in the sequence.
	- The first two terms of a Fibonacci sequence have the values `0` and `1`.
		- For example, a Fibonacci sequence with ten terms would look like this:
	    `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34`
	- Formally, this can be described as follows:
	  $F_0 = 0$
	  $F_1 = 1$
	  $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$
	- Write a command-line macOS app that prints the terms of Fibonacci sequence.
		- Solve this with two different implementations:
			- a recursive solution
			- a solution using iteration (one or more loops)

### Thread 1, Day 8 - Wednesday, November 2, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Streamlined Process for Generating a Single PDF of your Program Code
	- See [this very brief video for a demonstration of how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=0s) in just a couple of minutes.
	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> As shown in the video, be certain to remove your name from source code files as you work to generate your PDF. The College Board requires that no information that identifies you be present in code that you submit for the Create Task.
2. Scoring AP Create Task Written Responses
	- If you have not done this yet, [score your partner's responses](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0fbCsLsJ4x9e7HcCt46Gt13Lg#AP_Create_Task_-_Scoring_Guidelines_) for the Colour Selector app.
	- When your partner has finished doing the same for yours, compare notes.
3. Colour Selector ‚Äì AP Create Task ‚Äì Written Responses Exemplar
	- The hope is that the exercise of authoring your own responses, and then scoring someone else's responses, helped you understand the [Create Task requirements](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0sTIjatjDQDaHmoI_k-dNcnUQ#AP_Create_Task_-_Submission_Requirements).
	- ==Here is an [additional set of responses](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/071RgpqekOwKSdJCmS8ZdrDsA#Written_Responses_-_Colour_Selector_-_with_full_program_code) authored by Mr. Gordon.==
		- These responses have the requirements for each question, and the relevant portion of the scoring rubric, embedded in each page.
		- Hopefully, this will help you see exactly how these responses meet the criteria given by the College Board for this task.
4. AP Create Task: Working Period
	- The remainder of class time is dedicated to working on your [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/Create Task\|AP Create Task]].
#### To-do items
*Prior to our next class...*
- [ ] Spend some time working on your [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/Create Task\|AP Create Task]].
- [ ] Be certain to make a brief post on Spaces to share your progress.

### Thread 1, Day 6 - Friday, October 28, 2022
#### Agenda
1.  Building Apps with SwiftUI: Completing the Review
	- In yesterday's class we started to build the Colour Selector app.
		- [A video, part 1 of 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdz4QSbvSYU)  in a series recaps nearly everything we looked at in class yesterday.
	- For the first part of today's class, you will finish building the Colour Selector app.
		- [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTGa2xtUVHk) in the video series takes you through everything up to, but not including, writing the list filtering feature.
		> [!TIP]
		> If you'd like to begin with the second video, and have the very same source code that the second video starts with, you can [download that source code here](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ColourSelectorFall2022Video/archive/08e13e84773912bdbcd42130189d01c678ac8fee.zip).
		- The [Part 3 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_BpXOvstO4) is much shorter and explains how to filter the list.
2. Connecting Colour Selector to the AP Create Task
	- As a group, we will:
		- look at how the app meets the requirements of the AP Create Task
		- begin [authoring written responses](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0sTIjatjDQDaHmoI_k-dNcnUQ#AP_Create_Task_-_Submission_Requirements) for Colour Selector for the Create Task			
#### To-do items
*Prior to our next class...*
- [ ] Finish authoring written responses for the Colour Selector app, as if it were *your* app for the AP Create Task.
> [!TIP]
> ‚Ä¢ This will prepare you for a discussion in our next class, where we will compare our written responses and [you will score your practice responses using the Create Task rubric](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0fbCsLsJ4x9e7HcCt46Gt13Lg#AP_Create_Task_-_Scoring_Guidelines_).
> ‚Ä¢ Remember, Mr. Gordon cannot provide you with direct feedback on your own writing for the AP Create Task, but he *can* discuss your responses to exemplars (like Colour Selector) with you.

1.  Consolidation: Improving Bubble Sort
	- What change was required to get the worst-case efficiency to be roughly $\frac{n^2}{2}$ comparisons?
			- Under what starting conditions for the input array would this occur?
2.  Consolidation: Testing Bubble Sort
	- Referring to the Study tasks from [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Thread 1/Day 3\|our last class]] ‚Äì¬†would anyone like to share their progress with testing the real-world performance of the Bubble Sort algorithm?
3. Sort Race
	- You need to know the theoretical and real-world performance characteristics of common sort algorithms.
	- So far, we have looked at Bubble Sort and will review Insertion Sort and Selection Sort soon.
	- Please [make a copy of this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hYiNXQiGIvC848L_8wlGBsKzu00lxLvJ7DWPtfTPxM0/copy).
		- Then, [clone the Sort Race repository](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SortRace) and run the command-line program that it contains.
		- Over the coming weeks, use your computer to conduct trials of the three sort algorithms.
			- In other words ‚Äì fill in the spreadsheet.
			- It's best to run trials overnight, when you are not using your computer for other tasks.
		- We will compare notes at the end of this module, and complete a problem set to consolidate your understanding of the performance characteristics of these algorithms.
4. AP Create Task
	- We will spend the rest of today's class [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/Create Task\|reviewing requirements for the AP Create Task]].

#### To-do items
*Prior to our next class...*
- [ ] Consider what type of program you will write for the AP Create Task.
> [!Tip]
> Unless you feel strongly about another choice, it is suggested that you use the program you wrote last year for the Grade 11 Computer Science culminating task.
- [ ] Get a start on filling in the Sort Race spreadsheet for Bubble Sort.

### Thread 1, Day 2 - Thursday, October 20, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Introduction to Search Algorithms
	- What are the relative merits of a linear search as compared to a binary search?
		- [Linear search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwsgCHYmbbA&t=6s) works on an unsorted list (also known as an *array*).
		- [Binary search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T98PIp4omUA&t=6s) requires a sorted array, but is much faster at finding the desired value.
2. Evaluating our In-House Sort Algorithms
	- Review the algorithms we developed in our prior class.
	- A relatively straightforward sort algorithm is called the *bubble sort*...
3. Understanding Bubble Sort
	- To understand the efficiency of the bubble sort algorithm, we will implement it together.
		- Please create a new command-line project in Xcode named `BubbleSortImplementation` and then create a source control remote on GitHub.
	- For our algorithm, if $n$ is the number of elements in the array:
		- there will be $n - 1$ comparisons
		- there will be $n$ passes through the array
		- therefore there will be *exactly* $(n-1)(n)$ comparisons, or *roughly* $(n)(n)=n^2$ comparisons overall
			- for example, if the array has $10$ elements, then...
			   $\space\space\space\space\space n = 10$
			   ...that means there are *exactly*...
				$\space\space\space\space\space(n - 1)(n) = (9)(10) = 90$
			   ...and there are *roughly*...
				$\space\space\space\space\space(n)(n) = (10)(10) = 100$
			   ...comparisons that have occurred.
4. Improving Bubble Sort
	- Review the code we wrote together earlier.
		- Try running the program several times to get a sense of when swaps occur as more passes are completed.
		- Make at least one optimization to improve the efficiency of the algorithm.
			- This means reducing the number of comparisons required.
		- This [visualization of the Bubble Sort algorithm](https://visualgo.net/en/sorting?slide=7) may be useful.
		- Be sure to commit your work as you go.
		
#### To-do items
*Prior to our next class...*
- [ ] As described above, improve the efficiency of your Bubble Sort implementation.

	- This space is for private portfolio posts that will only be seen by Mr. Gordon:
	  ![individual-space.png|300](/img/user/Attachments/individual-space.png)
4. Update Operating System
	- To use the required version of Xcode, your computer must be upgraded to at least macOS Monterey version 12.5.1.
	- Choose Apple menu¬†Ô£ø > About This Mac to check what version you currently have.
	- Here is [how to upgrade](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212735), as needed.
	- You may wish to wait until this evening to complete a major upgrade, if that is necessary.
5. Download Xcode
	- You can download the [current version, 14.0.1, here](https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_14.0.1/Xcode_14.0.1.xip).
	- This will require logging in with your Apple Developer ID that was set up last year.
	- You may not have set up your Apple Developer ID last year; if you have not, please do so now using your LCS email address.
> [!TIP]
> Do not install Xcode via the App Store, as using this method means that it will automatically get upgraded when a new version is released (which is not always ideal).
6. Sorting Algorithms
	- With your group members, identify a method for sorting a list of numbers.
	- Be clear about the steps of your algorithm.
	- Remember basic concepts: sequence, selection (comparison), and iteration (loops).
		- Describe your algorithm using these building blocks.
	- Post a video in the class space [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) that clearly explains how your algorithm works.
		- Include an example where an unsorted list is sorted by following the steps of your algorithm.
		- Identify the members of your group.

#### To-do items
- [ ] Update your operating system, if needed; see notes above.
- [ ] Install Xcode; see notes above.
- [ ] Purchase required books; see the [course outline](https://tinyurl.com/lcscs22-g12-sco).
