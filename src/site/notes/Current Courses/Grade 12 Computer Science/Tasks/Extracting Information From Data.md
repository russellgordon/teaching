# Extracting Information From Data

## Obtain the Playground

First, please download the [Processing Data playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0bcQHOAKnwJjZxlOc1AQs-HQQ#Processing_Data):

And then open it:

## Learning Objectives

Your learning objectives for completing this task are:

1.  Identify the challenges associated with processing data.
2.  Select appropriate libraries or existing code segments to use in creating new programs.
3.  Explain how the use of computing can raise legal and ethical concerns.

## Questions to Consider

As you complete the playground, you should find yourself able to provide answers to these questions:
1. What challenges exist when processing large sets of data?
2.  Why might data need to be "cleaned"?
3.  What does it mean to "clean up" a data set?Â 
4.  What must be done before we can use third party code?
5.  Under what conditions should we use third party code, even if we don't fully understand how it works?
6.  What are the potential benefits of using third party code?
7.  Does most code stand alone, or use existing algorithms and libraries?
8.  What does "data translation" refer to?

## Companion Video

A companion video is provided to help you complete this playground:

## Instructions to Get Started

Work through the playground and write responses in your own words to the [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/Extracting Information From Data#Questions to Consider\|questions to consider]].

> [!TIP]
> Brain science research tells us that writing out answers on paper leads to better retention of the information. Consider this approach when answering the given questions.

As desired, use the [companion video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8YHO_Jji04) and _especially_ remember to use the chapter markers to move around and watch *just the parts* you want to see.

You can use the video to get an *introduction* to what is happening on a given page of the playground.
  
You can then simply  *check your work* (solution discussion)  or you can *get more detailed guidance* (solution development).
      
When complete, take a clear photo of your responses, and post [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/).
