# AP Create Task 

## Introduction

Before reading any further, please watch (or re-watch) this [53 second video demo of the "Multiplication Maestro" app](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2021-22/MultiplicationMaestro/).

That exemplar will look familiar!

*Multiplication Maestro* comprises an MVP (minimum viable product) for the AP Create Task.

Truly. An app this simple will more than meet the requirements for the AP Create Task.

It's generally easiest to understand what you need to do within the context of an example, so, please continue by looking through the links below that share an exemplar for this task.

## Exemplar

Multiplication Maestro is an MVP (minimum viable product) for the AP Create Task.

1. Watch the [53 second video demo of Multiplication Maestro](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2021-22/MultiplicationMaestro/).
2. Familiarize yourself with the source code [by reviewing commits step by step](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2021-22/MultiplicationMaestro/commits/).
	-  Here is the [list of commits for Multiplication Maestro](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/MultiplicationMaestro/commits/main).
    -  Green segments reflect code that was added in a given commit.
    -  Red segments reflect code that was removed.
4. [Clone the exemplar project](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/MultiplicationMaestro) and try it out.
    - Note the following:
        1. Code is written to be as simple to understand as possible. 
            - You can likely think of better ways to organize the code...
        2. Results are filtered [using an approach that is](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/MultiplicationMaestro/blob/8d20826a2c5db8e0ea06a941d9438384ca65891b/MultiplicationMaestro/Views/ContentView.swift#L219-L246):
            - designed to meet AP Create Task requirements
            - not the way you would filter a list "in real life" when writing an app using Swift and SwiftUI
5. Watch [this video that explains Create Task requirements and how the exemplar meets them](https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=xNn6gU_gvRo).
    - For the exemplar, here is: 
        - The [complete program code](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0caLxNLonU8msw2Q5Dr1athww#ap-create-task-program-code) as a PDF file
        - The [1-minute video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18REb5dUpQzt7bMegkwxZNVyBzAqMWAgR/view)
        - The [written responses](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0107uS_9h56RXKh3zNkoR3qfw#Written_Responses_-_With_Program_Code)

## Requirements

1. Read this one-page summary of [AP Create Task general requirements](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/01Zqqx5pFbNV7Euzk__rnjbQg#AP_Create_Task_-_General_Requirements).
2. Review the [detailed AP Create Task requirements](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0sTIjatjDQDaHmoI_k-dNcnUQ#AP_Create_Task_-_Submission_Requirements).
3. Understand the [AP Create Task rubric](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0fbCsLsJ4x9e7HcCt46Gt13Lg#AP_Create_Task_-_Scoring_Guidelines_).
    - These are the guidelines that the College Board evaluator will use to score your work.
    - To better understand requirements, watch [this video that compares the exemplar to the rubric](https://www.yout-ube.com/watch?v=xNn6gU_gvRo).

## Getting Started
1. Make a plan for your project.
    - While not formally required, paper prototypes may help organize your thoughts.
2. Author your program code – _source control must be used_.
    - Create your project in Xcode.
    - Create a remote.
    - Commit and push your code regularly, using [descriptive commit messages](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/MultiplicationMaestro/commits/main).
3. Test your code thoroughly and be certain to leave enough time to:
    1. Print your code to PDF.
	    - Here is how to do it in less than 5 minutes.
	        1. [Download, install, and open BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com).
	        2. Complete these steps – follow the links to see a video demo:
			- 00:00 - [Open Xcode and BBEdit side-by-side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=0s)
			- 00:06 - [Copy and paste each file into BBEdit, removing your name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=6s)
			- 01:23 - [Save the file in BBEdit with `.swift` as the file extension](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=83s)
			- 01:48 - [Print the document with line numbers and syntax highligting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=108s)
			- 02:31 - [Optionally print the document in landscape mode to show longer lines better](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=151s)
    2. Record your [1-minute video](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/04cejOeuaYZF5GyiI79x0JnEA#AP_Create_Task_-_Video).
        - The easiest way to record a video is to press `Command-R` when your app is running in the Simulator.
        - Here is [how to "make small text large"](https://www.russellgordon.ca/tips/embiggen-text-like-a-pro/) if you wish to use this effect in your video.
          
        > [!NOTE]
        > It is not required to show text captions within your video, although it is encouraged *if you have the time* as it makes the College Board evaluator's job easier.
        
    3. Author your written responses to the [required questions](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/088PneqzsLiNHeOKoFp_0eBiA#AP_Create_Task_-_Written_Responses).
	    - Be sure that code screenshots are legible – code cannot be so tiny that it becomes nearly impossible to read without a magnifying glass.
	      
4. When you are all finished, [submit your work to the College Board](https://digitalportfolio.collegeboard.org/).

## Final Notes

- All class periods after today leading up to the firm deadline of ==Wednesday November 9== will be working periods for you to complete this task.
- If you finish all or part of your AP Create Task in advance of our next module, you may use our class time in any way that you see fit, but you must be present in class, and of course, respectful of your peers' need to focus on completing their own work.
- Each day, at the end of class time, make a [brief post on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) to share an update on your progress and to ask clarifying questions.
