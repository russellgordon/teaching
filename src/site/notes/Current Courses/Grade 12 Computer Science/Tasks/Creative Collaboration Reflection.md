# Creative Collaboration Reflection

## Introduction

In this module you have engaged in a process of creative collaboration to extend the Chicago @ LCS app into Musicals @ LCS, an app more broadly focused on all musical productions staged at Lakefield College School.

Technical skills you have further developed include:

- how to query a relational database using SQL
- application of modular design concepts in computer programs (use of a view, model, and view model to separate concerns)

The greater focus has been upon how to manage the software development process within a team using source control and project management software.

## Reflection

At the conclusion of this module of the course you are invited to reflect upon the experience of participating in this teacher-led creative collaboration effort.

One purpose of this reflection is to self-evaluate your experience with an eye to becoming an even better member of a [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#B. Software Development\|student-led creative collaboration effort]] in the fourth and final module of this course.

Your reflection may take any of the following forms, all of which are equally valued:

- a typed written reflection
- a [sketchnote](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpbs.twimg.com%2Fmedia%2FDyiJBynUwAAdqAi.jpg%3Alarge&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=097c6c6a36ee40e6b750ca4ae8fe45d62caf644fa95e28e58699c56ccc23b3f1&ipo=images)
- an audio recording
- a video recording

Content – what you say or write – is far more important than polish.

The reflection is intended to be a task you complete within this 95-minute period. You will be required to complete nothing else during this period.

However, if you feel more time would be helpful, it may be submitted at any point up to 11 PM on Saturday.

When your reflection is complete, please [add it to your portfolio on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/).
