#### Agenda

1. [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/Extracting Information From Data|Extracting Information From Data]]
	- By our class on Monday morning, be sure you have completed this task and documented that with multiple screenshots on Spaces.
	- Have your answers to the [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/Extracting Information From Data#Questions to Consider|assigned questions]] ready for a round-table discussion – we will be using a specific protocol for that conversation.
2. Binary Numbers
	- Comparing the base 10 and base 2 number systems
	- How to convert from base 10 (decimal) to base 2 (binary)
		- If you like, you can later [watch this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rT8mS1w2MawnRnF0RyDaTF-7Zroc4e_I/view?usp=share_link) (less than 5 minutes long) which recaps the concept
		- Here is a written summary of [decimal to binary conversion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1878MgikvglczifzbR2Pl8ZX3gD9OhX6E/view?usp=share_link)
		- Here are some [conversions to try for practice](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vzjmmWwWgdtNMEalrTAjNx4Axrr1MU3h/view?usp=share_link)
		- You can [check your work with the macOS Calculator app](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NC2Nnu2994rXoba0UbEeFoI9fUC5fHZp/view)
3. The Internet: Packets, Routing, and Reliability
	- Your goal is to have [an understanding of what these terms mean](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RS-kR5Bv4ljxBE3ZyJCwX5KOaSFJ77if/view?usp=share_link) – please begin making a glossary in your own words – handwritten is ideal for long-term memory retention.
		- To warm up on this topic, please [watch this short video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYdF7b3nMto) (less than 10 minutes) where Lynn Root, a Spotify engineer, and Vint Cerf – one of the co-creators of the internet – explains what packets are and how routing works to make the Internet reliable
		- Then, for a deeper dive, please [read this excerpt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17twDnLX5mt4NI2vlFaJEmxaMO9esyHq5/view?usp=share_link) from [Blown to Bits](https://www.bitsbook.com/thebook/)
		- ==Remember==, as you watch the video and read that excerpt, add notes to your glossary [for these terms](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RS-kR5Bv4ljxBE3ZyJCwX5KOaSFJ77if/view?usp=share_link)
