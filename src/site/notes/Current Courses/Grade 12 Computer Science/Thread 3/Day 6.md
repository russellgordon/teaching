### Thread 3, Day 6 - Wednesday, April 5, 2023
#### Agenda

1. [Safe Computing: User Authentication](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y4UCP3W2BgTblKPg36t1cU7A0n2DThb7/view?usp=share_link)
	- What is a strong password?
	- What is a password manager?
	- Multi-factor authentication
2. Sort Race
	- Remember this? 
	- Next week, we need to finish comparing theoretical and real-world performance characteristics of common sort algorithms.
	- It's been quite a while, so you *might* need to make a new [copy of this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hYiNXQiGIvC848L_8wlGBsKzu00lxLvJ7DWPtfTPxM0/copy).
		- Then, [clone the Sort Race repository](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SortRace) and run the command-line program that it contains.
		- Over the long weekend, please use your computer to conduct trials of the three sort algorithms.
			- In other words â€“ fill in the spreadsheet.
			- It's best to run trials overnight, when you are not using your computer for other tasks.
		- We will compare notes next week  and complete a problem set to build your understanding of the performance characteristics of these algorithms.
3. Quiz: Data, Networks, Impact of Computing
	- Check your knowledge of topics we looked at over the first four days of this module.
