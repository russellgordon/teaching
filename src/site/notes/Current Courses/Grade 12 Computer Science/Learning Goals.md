# Learning Goals
Here are the learning goals for Grade 12 Computer Science (ICS4Ue, AP).

For all learning goals, we will engage in further discussion.

Exemplars of suitable evidence for each learning goal will be shared as the course unfolds.

## 1

I can identify and correct both logical errors and syntax errors in my code, and employ effective code maintenance techniques such as unit tests, test plans, internal documentation, and user-facing documentation.
<small>Ontario: [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#A4.\|A4]] / AP CSP: [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#4. Code Analysis\|4]], [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#6. Responsible Computing\|6]]</small>

## 2

I can use source control and related project management tools to organize and describe improvements made in a project ‚Äì including in projects co-authored with other people.
<small>Ontario: [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#B1.\|B1]] / AP CSP: [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#1. Computational Solution Design\|1]]</small>

## 3

I understand data types (simple types, collection types, and custom types) and know when to use them as variables or constants in my programs.
<small>Ontario: [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#A1.\|A1]], [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#A2.\|A2]] / AP CSP: [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#3. Abstraction in Program Development\|3]]</small>

## 4

I can design and implement algorithms that sort, search, and manipulate lists of data ‚Äì including data in two-dimensional arrays.
<small>Ontario: [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#A3.\|A3]] / AP CSP: [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#2. Algorithms and Program Development\|2]]</small>

## 5

I understand the concept of abstraction and can apply it (using loops, functions, structures, classes, or other means) to reduce code duplication and make program maintenance easier.
<small>Ontario: [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#A2.\|A2]], [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#C1.\|C1]] / AP CSP: [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#3. Abstraction in Program Development\|3]]</small>

## 6

I can apply Agile software development principles to design and deliver solutions to authentic problems for an external audience when working individually and within a group.
<small>Ontario: [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#B1.\|B1]], [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#B2.\|B2]] / AP CSP: [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#1. Computational Solution Design\|1]], [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#6. Responsible Computing\|6]]</small>

## 7

I can analyze algorithms for their effectiveness when solving a given problem and compare the theoretical and practice performance of an algorithm across various scenarios.
<small>Ontario: [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#C2.\|C2]] / AP CSP: [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#4. Code Analysis\|4]]</small>

## 8

I can assess initiatives to promote environmental stewardship related to the use of computers, analyse ethical issues in the computing industry, and propose strategies to encourage responsible development of computer hardware and software.
<small>Ontario: [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#D1.\|D1]], [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#D2.\|D2]] / AP CSP: [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#5. Computing Innovations\|5]]</small>

## 9

I can analyse the impact of computing innovations (including but not limited to artificial intelligence, cryptography, augmented reality) on our society and economy.
<small>Ontario: Ontario: [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#D3.\|D3]], [[Curriculum/Computer Science, Grade 12#D4.\|D4]] / AP CSP: [[Curriculum/AP Computer Science Principles#5. Computing Innovations\|5]]</small>

## 10

I can maintain a public-facing portfolio of my work in this class to facilitate applications to post-secondary programs of study and summer employment.
