#### Agenda

1. [Culminating Task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GwghXQoAbWKPtktJqnWASLAaNNkgSr4l/view?usp=share_link)
	- How to update information in the database

	> Here is the video recording of side session where we looked at [how to add statistics tracking to the CYOA template](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qdir7jp9o-8).https://youtu.be/XBdF255msGs
	> It is not recommended to watch this entire video as it is quite long, but may be useful as a reference to review a particular part of the process.

	- Working period to make progress on your group's app
	> [!NOTE]
	> If you are working to populate your group's database, see [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/The Culminating Task#Database Population\|these notes documenting the necessary steps]].
	> 
	> If you are making regular updates to your group's database structure or the data it contains, [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/The Culminating Task#Understanding the simulator and the database relationship\|see these notes on how to ensure your new database is being used within the iOS simulator]].
