	- A self-paced tutorial to understand how MVVM can help you write applications for multiple platforms without repeating code.

	- Next Monday, Rick and Sarah from StarCam will visit us again in person.
		- By Zoom, the following people will also be joining us:
			- Greg (owner and CEO)
			- David (primary developer)
	- Look for a post from Rick or Sarah in their space [on our Spaces page](https://ca.spacesedu.com/).
		- Please reply with (at least one) question(s) that you have related to technology or business development for StarCam. This will help their team prepare to give us the best possible answers.
		  
			- For example, some questions Mr. Gordon would like to ask:
			  
			  *How does your company track issues to be completed for StarCam?*
			  
			  *How are releases organized and planned within your project management software?*
			  
			  *To what extent does your company use unit tests? Integration testing?*
