### Thread 2, Day 10 - Thursday, January 26, 2023
#### Agenda

1. Chicago @ LCS: Ignoring certain files for source control
	- Open the Terminal app on your computer.
	- Then [visit this page](https://www.russellgordon.ca/gitignore-setup.txt).
	- Copy the commands at that page into the Terminal.
	- Restart Xcode.
	- This ensures that files that should not be tracked for source control will not accidentally be committed.
2. Musicals @ LCS: Populating the Normalized Database
	- Dividing up work to populate the database with information for Chicago and Anything Goes.
		- Use [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com) to write the SQL.
		- Refer to the [original database schema diagram](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2022-23/ics4u/normalized-musicals-at-lcs-database-schema.png) or this [alternate version](https://www.russellgordon.ca/lcs/2022-23/ics4u/normalized-musicals-at-lcs-database-schema-alternate.png) â€“ whatever you find easier to read.
