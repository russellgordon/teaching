### Thread 1, Day 15 - Friday, November 18, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Drawing Custom Shapes with SwiftUI: A few creations...
	- Share some examples of shapes created 

2. Using Iteration and Recursion to Draw Shapes
	- We will reproduce this image:

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can access the code we developed in class [by cloning this repository](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ShrinkingCircles) or simply [browsing the history of commits](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/ShrinkingCircles/commits/main).

3. Exercise: Create More Custom Shapes Using Iteration or Recursion
	- Work in at least a pair to create images that employ iteration or recursion.
		- Whether you use iteration or recursion is up to you.
		- Here are two possibilities that would be a good challenge:

> [!TIP]
> When you create your shapes, do not use fixed co-ordinates. Instead, make use of `rect.height`, `rect.maxY`, and other properties of the `CGRect` that is provided to the `path` function, so that your shapes *scale* as the size of the window or device changes.
