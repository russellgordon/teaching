### Thread 1, Day 1 - Tuesday, October 18, 2022
#### Agenda
1. LCAT
	- Please complete your [daily LCAT check](https://lcat.lcs.on.ca) prior to coming to class.
2. [Course Outline](https://tinyurl.com/lcscs22-g12-sco)
3. Join [our class on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/class/CA-C0fNK8br).
	- This space is for shared posts you want everyone to see:

4. Update Operating System
	- To use the required version of Xcode, your computer must be upgraded to at least macOS Monterey version 12.5.1.
	- Choose Apple menu  > About This Mac to check what version you currently have.
	- Here is [how to upgrade](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212735), as needed.
	- You may wish to wait until this evening to complete a major upgrade, if that is necessary.
5. Download Xcode
	- You can download the [current version, 14.0.1, here](https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_14.0.1/Xcode_14.0.1.xip).
	- This will require logging in with your Apple Developer ID that was set up last year.
	- You may not have set up your Apple Developer ID last year; if you have not, please do so now using your LCS email address.
> [!TIP]
> Do not install Xcode via the App Store, as using this method means that it will automatically get upgraded when a new version is released (which is not always ideal).
6. Sorting Algorithms
	- With your group members, identify a method for sorting a list of numbers.
	- Be clear about the steps of your algorithm.
	- Remember basic concepts: sequence, selection (comparison), and iteration (loops).
		- Describe your algorithm using these building blocks.
	- Post a video in the class space [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) that clearly explains how your algorithm works.
		- Include an example where an unsorted list is sorted by following the steps of your algorithm.
		- Identify the members of your group.
