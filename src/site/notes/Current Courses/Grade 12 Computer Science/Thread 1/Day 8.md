### Thread 1, Day 8 - Wednesday, November 2, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Streamlined Process for Generating a Single PDF of your Program Code
	- See [this very brief video for a demonstration of how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szNtDddK0T0&t=0s) in just a couple of minutes.
	> [!IMPORTANT]
	> As shown in the video, be certain to remove your name from source code files as you work to generate your PDF. The College Board requires that no information that identifies you be present in code that you submit for the Create Task.
2. Scoring AP Create Task Written Responses
	- If you have not done this yet, [score your partner's responses](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0fbCsLsJ4x9e7HcCt46Gt13Lg#AP_Create_Task_-_Scoring_Guidelines_) for the Colour Selector app.
	- When your partner has finished doing the same for yours, compare notes.
3. Colour Selector – AP Create Task – Written Responses Exemplar
	- The hope is that the exercise of authoring your own responses, and then scoring someone else's responses, helped you understand the [Create Task requirements](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0sTIjatjDQDaHmoI_k-dNcnUQ#AP_Create_Task_-_Submission_Requirements).
	- ==Here is an [additional set of responses](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/071RgpqekOwKSdJCmS8ZdrDsA#Written_Responses_-_Colour_Selector_-_with_full_program_code) authored by Mr. Gordon.==
		- These responses have the requirements for each question, and the relevant portion of the scoring rubric, embedded in each page.
		- Hopefully, this will help you see exactly how these responses meet the criteria given by the College Board for this task.
4. AP Create Task: Working Period
	- The remainder of class time is dedicated to working on your [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/Create Task|AP Create Task]].

> [!NOTE]
> • The firm due date for the AP Create Task is next Wednesday, November 9.
