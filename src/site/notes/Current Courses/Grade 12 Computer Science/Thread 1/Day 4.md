### Thread 1, Day 4 - Tuesday, October 25, 2022
#### Agenda
1.  Consolidation: Improving Bubble Sort
	- What change was required to get the worst-case efficiency to be roughly $\frac{n^2}{2}$ comparisons?
			- Under what starting conditions for the input array would this occur?
2.  Consolidation: Testing Bubble Sort
	- Referring to the Study tasks from [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Thread 1/Day 3\|our last class]] – would anyone like to share their progress with testing the real-world performance of the Bubble Sort algorithm?
3. Sort Race
	- You need to know the theoretical and real-world performance characteristics of common sort algorithms.
	- So far, we have looked at Bubble Sort and will review Insertion Sort and Selection Sort soon.
	- Please [make a copy of this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hYiNXQiGIvC848L_8wlGBsKzu00lxLvJ7DWPtfTPxM0/copy).
		- Then, [clone the Sort Race repository](https://github.com/lcs-rgordon/SortRace) and run the command-line program that it contains.
		- Over the coming weeks, use your computer to conduct trials of the three sort algorithms.
			- In other words – fill in the spreadsheet.
			- It's best to run trials overnight, when you are not using your computer for other tasks.
		- We will compare notes at the end of this module, and complete a problem set to consolidate your understanding of the performance characteristics of these algorithms.
4. AP Create Task
	- We will spend the rest of today's class [[Current Courses/Grade 12 Computer Science/Tasks/Create Task\|reviewing requirements for the AP Create Task]].

#### To-do items
*Prior to our next class...*
- [ ] Consider what type of program you will write for the AP Create Task.
> [!Tip]
> Unless you feel strongly about another choice, it is suggested that you use the program you wrote last year for the Grade 11 Computer Science culminating task.
- [ ] Get a start on filling in the Sort Race spreadsheet for Bubble Sort.
