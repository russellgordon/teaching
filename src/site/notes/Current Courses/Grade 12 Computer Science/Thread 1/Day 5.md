### Thread 1, Day 5 - Thursday, October 27, 2022
#### Agenda
1.  Building Apps with SwiftUI: Review
	- In today's class we started to build the Colour Selector app.
		- This [video (part 1 of 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tdz4QSbvSYU) recaps nearly everything we looked at in class today.
			- As needed, please take a look at all or part of this video.
			- Feel free to watch the video at whatever speed works for you (I often watch videos at 1.25x speed).
			- Remember, you can use the chapter markers to find the information most relevant to your needs:
