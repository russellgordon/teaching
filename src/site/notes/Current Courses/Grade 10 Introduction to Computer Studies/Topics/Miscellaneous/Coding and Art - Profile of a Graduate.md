# Coding + Art: Profile of a Graduate

Writing code is an abstract task.

Seeing graphical output from the code you write as a beginning programmer helps to make the abstract *concrete* – that is to to say – more easily understood.

So while in one sense we create graphical output in this course as a *means to an end* – learning to program a computer – it turns out that programming a computer to express yourself creatively is something that many people do professionally.

Jamie Haberman is a past student of mine, a graduate of [The Bishop Strachan School](https://www.bss.on.ca), who attended the [Iovine and Young Academy at the University of Southern California](https://iovine-young.usc.edu/discover/founders) after finishing high school.

Jamie is now a [product designer in Silicon Valley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-haberman-482958114/) but in 2014, she was experimenting with iteration in my class in a course very similar to the one you are in now.
