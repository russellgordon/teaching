# Thread 2 - Interim Portfolio Review
## How does this work?
For this portfolio review at the midpoint of our second thread of study in this course, you will cast an appraising eye at your portfolio, and decide whether you are, currently:

- Approaching expectations
- Meeting expectations
- Exceeeding expectations

For this portfolio review:

- No numeric grade will be determined.
- Consider only your posts for work completed in the second thread of this course – since we have not yet revisited any of the learning goals we worked on in the first thread.

The overall purpose of your portfolio is to provide evidence of mastery of the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Learning Goals|course learning goals]].

To *meet* expectations, be sure you have completed all required exercises from days 1 to 7:

- [ ] video showing navigation of organized folders in Google Drive (or, multiple screenshots)
- [ ] keyboard shortcuts – screenshots of five favourites, screen recording(s) showing that you using two of them
- [ ] touch typing – step 1 exercises, section 1 frequent words completed
- [ ] using styles in a Google Doc – module 3 goals
- [ ] SheetBoss – SUM lessons (4) and COUNT lessons (3) completed
- [ ] Weekend Camp at Northcote task
- [ ] Spreadsheet Skills Pyramid task

Please visit the relevant pages from days 1 to 7 for further details.

==Evidence of the above must exist in your portfolio on Spaces.==

To *exceed* expectations, you have completed tasks that go above and beyond, such as any optional tasks that were offered by Mr. Gordon – or you have added other evidence to your portfolio related to the topics we have looked at since the start of the second thread.
