# Thread 2 - Interim Portfolio Review
## How does this work?
For this portfolio review at the midpoint of our second thread of study in this course, you will cast an appraising eye at your portfolio, and decide whether you are, currently:

- Approaching expectations
- Meeting expectations
- Exceeeding expectations

For this portfolio review:

- No numeric grade will be determined.
- Consider only your posts for work completed in the second thread of this course – since we have not yet revisited any of the learning goals we worked on in the first thread.

The overall purpose of your portfolio is to provide evidence of mastery of the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Learning Goals|course learning goals]].

To *meet* expectations, be sure you have completed all required exercises from days 1 to 7. Evidence must exist in your portfolio on Spaces.

To *exceed* expectations, you have completed tasks that go above and beyond, such as any optional tasks that were offered by Mr. Gordon – or you have added other evidence to your portfolio related to the topics we have looked at since the start of the second thread.

## What to do
==No later 10 PM on Sunday December 4 – the night before your meeting with Mr. Gordon==, please:
- [ ] Make a brief post [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/)
- [ ] Title the post "Thread 2 – Midpoint – Portfolio Review"
- [ ] Write *briefly* to support your case for the level of achievement you feel you have earned
