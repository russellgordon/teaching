# Initial Portfolio Review
## How does this work?
For this portfolio review at the midpoint of our first thread of study in this course, you will cast an appraising eye at your portfolio, and decide whether you are, currently:

- Approaching expectations
- Meeting expectations
- Exceeeding expectations

For this portfolio review, only these levels will be used. No numeric grade will be determined.

The overall purpose of your portfolio is to provide evidence of mastery of the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Learning Goals\|course learning goals]].

To *meet* expectations, be sure you have:
- [ ] met the success criteria for [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Introduction\|all tasks to date]]
	- [ ] documented this by adding screenshots, photos, or videos to your portfolio
- [ ] responded fully to reflection prompts

If you do not have evidence in your portfolio of having met the success criteria for [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Introduction\|all tasks]], you are *approaching* expectations.

If you have evidence in your portfolio that suggests further mastery of a [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Learning Goals\|course learning goal]], but which was not explicitly spelled out in the success criteria for a task, you may be *exceeding* expectations.
