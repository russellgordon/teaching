# Exercise: A Winter Wonderland 

- We have learned about:
	- sequence (order of statements)
	- iteration (use of loops, including nested loops)
	- selection (use of `if` statement)
	- abstraction (use of functions)
- Use as many of these concepts as you can to build a festive "winter wonderland" scene, since the Winter Break is approaching.
- As usual, ensure your code is well organized and easy to read, and share your progress on Spaces.
