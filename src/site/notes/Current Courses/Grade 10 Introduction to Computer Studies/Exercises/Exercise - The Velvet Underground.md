Reproduce the following gig poster:

![the velvet underground - no grid.png|800](/img/user/Attachments/the%20velvet%20underground%20-%20no%20grid.png)

- Analyse the design and make a brief plan.

	- iteration (use of loops, including nested loops)
	- selection (use of `if` statement)
	- abstraction (use of functions)

Here is a version with a grid:
