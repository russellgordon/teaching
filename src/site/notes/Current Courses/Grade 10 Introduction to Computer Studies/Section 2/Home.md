### Thread 1, Day 13 - Wednesday, October 12, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Please ==read the replies== made to your recent posts [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/).
	- If you did not provide any updates yesterday, please do that *first* today before continuing to write more code.
	- As always, reply to these two prompts:
		i. What did I learn or make progress upon today?
		ii. What do I have questions about / what am I struggling with?
2. Then, continue working on the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints|T-shirt Shadow Prints]] task.
	- Use black, white, and shades of grey only (recall the [process we are using to transfer designs to a shirt](http://www.inkodye.com/guides/photo)).
	- To "turn off" fills, [[Media/Using a Clear Fill Colour|set the fill color to "clear"]].
	
#### To-do items
- [ ] No later than 10 PM tomorrow – Thursday – hand in the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints|T-shirt Shadow Prints]] task using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwa6DH8Ylbvn45avDXNTmyqi2c-4BYp4h0mvsYicFdmxBtiw/viewform).
	- Use the same drag and drop process you used to hand in your Campus Line Drawing.
