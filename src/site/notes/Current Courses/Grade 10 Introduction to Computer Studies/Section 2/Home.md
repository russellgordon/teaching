## Most Recent Class

<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">




### Thread 4, Day 6 - Wednesday, May 3, 2023
#### Agenda

1. [Continuing the Culminating Task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u38zFv5pM8oAZX8ToLfufQNDvfuUKy60/view?usp=share_link)
	- Continue implementation of your first design for the culminating task
	> [!TIP]
	> Please remember to:
	> 1. Make a plan and share it [to Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) before you write code.
	> 2. Look for ways to exceed expectations, such as:
	> 	- use of colour
	> 	- use of fills
	> 	- creating multiple tessellations
	> 3. When you post on Spaces, use subject-specific vocabulary to provide some details about *how* you completed the tessellation. 
	> 	- Where was sequence important?
	> 	- When did you use iteration?
	> 	- Where did you apply abstraction, and how does that help?

#### To-do items
