### Thread 1, Day 12 - Tuesday, October 11, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Please hand in the final version of your Campus Line Drawing playground to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgvy6K9Y1TzBLw6J2OqjClI39Vj5f-x6wlil2kqE9wH1tVKQ/viewform).
	- Here is a [[Media/Handing in your Campus Line Drawing\|short animation showing how to hand in your drawing]].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please double check that you are handing in the correct file by first running the playground file before handing it in.

2. Filling Shapes
	- The [latest version of the Turtle Sketches playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/030Bsp7EIEhY1TnLkzuz9v76w#Turtle_Sketches_Template_v4-1), version 4.1, allows for shapes to be filled.
	- To "turn off" fills, [[Media/Using a Clear Fill Colour\|set the fill color to "clear"]].

3. Continue the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints\|T-shirt Shadow Prints]] task.
	- Ideally, at the start of today's class, your [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints#Exemplar\|plan]] is complete and you have shared that progress [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/)
		- If not, finish and share your plan as your first priority.
	- Once your plan is complete, begin coding your design.
	
> [!TIP]
> • Remember, you need [high contrast](http://www.inkodye.com/guides/photo) in your design – black, white, and maybe one shade of grey.
> • Do not use color.
	
#### To-do items
