### Thread 1, Day 12 - Tuesday, October 11, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Please hand in the final version of your Campus Line Drawing playground to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgvy6K9Y1TzBLw6J2OqjClI39Vj5f-x6wlil2kqE9wH1tVKQ/viewform).
	- Here is a [[Media/Handing in your Campus Line Drawing|short animation showing how to hand in your drawing]].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please double check that you are handing in the correct file by first running the playground file before handing it in.

2. Continue the [[Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints|T-shirt Shadow Prints]] task.
	- Ideally, at the start of today's class, your [[Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints#Exemplar|plan]] is complete and you have shared that progress [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/)
		- If not, finish and share your plan as your first priority.
	- Once your plan is complete, begin coding your design.
	
> [!TIP]
> • Remember, you need [high contrast](http://www.inkodye.com/guides/photo) in your design – black, white, and maybe one shade of grey.
> • Do not use color.

3. Filling Shapes
	- The [latest version of the Turtle Sketches playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/030Bsp7EIEhY1TnLkzuz9v76w#Turtle_Sketches_Template_v4-1), version 4.1, allows for shapes to be filled.
	- To "turn off" fills, [[Media/Using a Clear Fill Colour|set the fill color to "clear"]].
	
#### To-do items
- [ ] Make significant progress on your [[Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints|T-shirt Shadow Prints]] task.

> [!NOTE]
> • Your design must be completely coded and [handed in](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwa6DH8Ylbvn45avDXNTmyqi2c-4BYp4h0mvsYicFdmxBtiw/viewform) by the end of class tomorrow.
> • Recall that Mr. Gordon needs time to [print your design to get it ready for transferring to your T-shirt](http://www.inkodye.com/guides/photo) on Friday, October 14.
