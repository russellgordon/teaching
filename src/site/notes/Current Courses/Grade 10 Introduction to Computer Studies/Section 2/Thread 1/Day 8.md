### Thread 1, Day 8 - Friday, September 30, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [Night Eye](https://nighteye.app/)
	- Another "dark mode" extension for desktop and mobile web browsers and operating systems.
	- Not quite as nice as [Noir](https://getnoir.app/) in my personal experience â€“ but Night Eye is free.
	- It is available for a wide variety of platforms (see the ["Install" link at the top of their website](https://nighteye.app/)).
2. Process over product
	- Documenting the evolution of your work in steps will be helpful later this year when you are asked to describe your growth as a student in this course.
	- If you haven't yet, please be sure to make a [post on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) to share your progress since our last class.
3. Working time
	- You have the rest of this class to make progress on the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing|Campus Line Drawing]] task.
