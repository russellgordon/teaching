### Thread 1, Day 6 - Monday, September 26, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Portfolios/Initial Portfolio Review\|Initial Portfolio Review]]
	- In our final class this week (Saturday) you will meet individually with Mr. Gordon to propose a level of achievement.
2. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Iteration#Applying iteration\|Applying Iteration]]
	- When using loops to make part of a drawing:
		a. carefully isolate the actions to be repeated
		b. finish drawing where you started
		c. then move to where you want the next "repeat" of the drawing to occur
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Functions\|Using Functions to "Chunk" a Sketch]]
	- Rather than drawing one part of a sketch, then moving directly on to draw the next part, it's helpful to keep each part of a sketch separate from the next.
	- You can do this by returning to the origin in between drawing each part.
	- In this way, if you move one block of code around in your program, it doesn't affect the other parts.
4. Working time
	- You have the remainder of class time today to make progress on your [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing\|Campus Line Drawing]] task.
 
#### To-do items
*Before our next class, please...*

> [!NOTE]
> There is no expectation that you work on the plan or code for this task this evening. You will have the next two classes to continue working on this task.
