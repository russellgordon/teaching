### Thread 1, Day 4 - Wednesday, September 21, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Finish the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate task]].
	- Be certain you made a plan.
		- Share a photo of your plan [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/).
		- Review the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Name Plate#Exemplar\|exemplar]] for a plan carefully.
	- Be sure to respond to the reflection questions on Spaces.
2. Optionally, to enhance your portfolio of work, make additions to your name plate sketch.
	- Consider adding small line drawing(s) of something that connects to your interests.
		- For example, for me, that would be baseball and the Blue Jays. ðŸ˜Ž So, I might try using the `addArc` command to have the turtle draw a circle, and then attempt to make a drawing of a baseball near my name. Something like this would be a good challenge:

		- Note that with the `addArc` command you can draw parts of a full circle by using an angle less than 360Â°.
	- Completing an extension like this would be great additional evidence for [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Learning Goals#2\|learning goal 2]].
