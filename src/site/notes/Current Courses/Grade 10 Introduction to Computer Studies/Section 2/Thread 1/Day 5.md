### Thread 1, Day 5 - Friday, September 23, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/)
	- Please take a moment to read your replies from me.
	- If I've requested some additional info, please complete those short tasks later on, during Study time.
		- Requests for more information come from a place of wanting your portfolio to be in the best shape it can be to show your eventual mastery of our [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Section 2/Learning Goals|course learning goals]]. üëçüèº
2. [Keyboard shortcuts in Playgrounds](https://www.russellgordon.ca/tutorials/keyboard-shortcuts-in-playgrounds/) allow you to work more efficiently.
	- Bookmark that page for future reference.
3. [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
	- Programming can be hard, both for beginners and experienced software developers.
	- If you are running into syntax errors or logical errors and perhaps getting frustrated: that is normal!
	- Pairing with a friend to describe what you are trying to do with your code, line by line, can be helpful.
		- Often during this process, you will realize the source of the problem you are having.
	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! ü¶Ü
4. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Sequence|Sequence]]
	- Does sequence of statements matter? Yes.
5. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Iteration|Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Iteration]]
	- A computer is very good at repeatedly doing the same thing.
	- We can use a loop to describe what instructions should be repeated.
	- We say that a computer *iterates* when it repeatedly runs a set of instructions.
6. Introduce [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing|Campus Line Drawing]] task
	- Complete a walk around campus to find suitable locations.
6. Working time in class
	- If needed:
		- [ ] polish your Spaces posts
		- [ ] finish up the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Name Plate|Name Plate task]] task
	- Or:
		- [ ] begin the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing|Campus Line Drawing]] task.
 
#### To-do items
*Before our next class, please...*

- [ ] If requested in my replies to your [Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) posts, please provide additional information.

	- ==NOTE==: You will also have class time over the next several periods to work on this task.
