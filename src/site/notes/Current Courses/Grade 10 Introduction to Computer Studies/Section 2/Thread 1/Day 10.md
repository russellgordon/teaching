### Thread 1, Day 10 - Monday, October 3, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [Updated Sketches Playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/030Bsp7EIEhY1TnLkzuz9v76w#Turtle_Sketches_Template_v4-1)
	- Please download this new version, which allows for line by line debugging and some other useful features.
2. Using Functions with Parameters
	- Functions are used to "teach the computer a new trick".
		- The formal word for this is *encapsulation* which means we wrap up many steps into a function so we can simply use, or *call*, the function in a single step, or line, or code.
	- Functions are made more useful when we can pass information to them, like we did with this function to control the size of the square that will be drawn:
