#### Agenda
1. Hardcover graph paper notebooks.

3. Automation with Automator: Image Format Conversion
	- *Automation* refers to the act of programming a computer to complete otherwise very repetitive and tedious tasks for you.
	- [Automator is a Mac application](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/automator/welcome/mac) that lets you describe tasks you would like to be automated.
	- We will use Automator to create an app that converts images in HEIC format to JPEG format:
