### Thread 4, Day 6 - Wednesday, May 3, 2023
#### Agenda

1. [Continuing the Culminating Task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u38zFv5pM8oAZX8ToLfufQNDvfuUKy60/view?usp=share_link)
	- A look at [the template to help you prepare](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12h0pSHiPWGYuzAgrobpMbrziXf_BvU0HaqKhb2_YXy0/copy) for the end of year interview.
	- Continue implementation of your first design for the culminating task
	> [!TIP]
	> Please remember to:
	> 1. Make a plan and share it [to Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) before you write code.
	> 2. Keep your code organized, by:
	> 	- Selecting meaningful names for functions (custom blocks).
	> 	- Using comments to identify the purpose of a section of code.
	> 3. Look for ways to exceed expectations, such as:
	> 	- use of colour
	> 	- use of fills
	> 	- creating multiple tessellations
	> 4. When you post on Spaces, use subject-specific vocabulary to provide some details about *how* you completed the tessellation. 
	> 	- Where was sequence important?
	> 	- When did you use iteration?
	> 	- Where did you apply abstraction, and how does that help?
