### Thread 4, Day 8 - Tuesday, May 9, 2023
#### Agenda

1. [Continuing the Culminating Task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u38zFv5pM8oAZX8ToLfufQNDvfuUKy60/view?usp=share_link)
	- Continue working on your culminating task
	- Work on a second or third tessellation if you have completed your first one
	- Interested in trying a different type of design? Ask Mr. Gordon for more details...
	> [!TIP]
	> Please remember to:
	> 1. Make a plan and share it [to Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) before you write code.
	> 2. Keep your code organized, by:
	> 	- Selecting meaningful names for functions (custom blocks).
	> 	- Using comments to identify the purpose of a section of code.
	> 3. Look for ways to exceed expectations, such as:
	> 	- use of colour
	> 	- use of fills
	> 	- creating multiple tessellations
	> 4. When you post on Spaces, use subject-specific vocabulary to provide some details about *how* you completed the tessellation. 
	> 	- Where was sequence important?
	> 	- When did you use iteration?
	> 	- Where did you apply abstraction, and how does that help?

### Thread 2, Day 6 - Thursday, December 1, 2022
#### Agenda

1. Portfolios: Updates and Replies
	- Please be certain you are reading replies.

2. Example: [Monthly Precipitation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zG6a8AvTOttjlPOjiPG6OmLD9mrvcOmwmIZAGQeFIiE/copy)
	- In which we revisit the cardinal rule of spreadsheet design: never use a literal number in a formula.
	- Instead, use formulas and cell references only.

### Thread 1, Day 10 - Monday, October 3, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [Updated Sketches Playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/030Bsp7EIEhY1TnLkzuz9v76w#Turtle_Sketches_Template_v4-1)
	- Please download this new version, which allows for line by line debugging and some other useful features.
2. Using Functions with Parameters
	- Functions are used to "teach the computer a new trick".
		- The formal word for this is *encapsulation* which means we wrap up many steps into a function so we can simply use, or *call*, the function in a single step, or line, or code.
	- Functions are made more useful when we can pass information to them, like we did with this function to control the size of the square that will be drawn:

### Thread 1, Day 6 - Monday, September 26, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Portfolios/Initial Portfolio Review\|Initial Portfolio Review]]
	- In our final class this week (Saturday) you will meet individually with Mr. Gordon to propose a level of achievement.
2. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Iteration#Applying iteration\|Applying Iteration]]
	- When using loops to make part of a drawing:
		a. carefully isolate the actions to be repeated
		b. finish drawing where you started
		c. then move to where you want the next "repeat" of the drawing to occur
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Functions\|Using Functions to "Chunk" a Sketch]]
	- Rather than drawing one part of a sketch, then moving directly on to draw the next part, it's helpful to keep each part of a sketch separate from the next.
	- You can do this by returning to the origin in between drawing each part.
	- In this way, if you move one block of code around in your program, it doesn't affect the other parts.
4. Working time
	- You have the remainder of class time today to make progress on your [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing\|Campus Line Drawing]] task.
 
#### To-do items
*Before our next class, please...*

- [ ] For the Campus Line Drawing task, make a post [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) to reply to the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing#Reflection prompts\|reflection prompts]].
> [!NOTE]
> There is no expectation that you work on the plan or code for this task this evening. You will have the next two classes to continue working on this task.

### Thread 1, Day 5 - Friday, September 23, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/)
	- Please take a moment to read your replies from me.
	- If I've requested some additional info, please complete those short tasks later on, during Study time.
		- Requests for more information come from a place of wanting your portfolio to be in the best shape it can be to show your eventual mastery of our [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Section 2/Learning Goals\|course learning goals]]. 👍🏼
2. [Keyboard shortcuts in Playgrounds](https://www.russellgordon.ca/tutorials/keyboard-shortcuts-in-playgrounds/) allow you to work more efficiently.
	- Bookmark that page for future reference.
3. [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
	- Programming can be hard, both for beginners and experienced software developers.
	- If you are running into syntax errors or logical errors and perhaps getting frustrated: that is normal!
	- Pairing with a friend to describe what you are trying to do with your code, line by line, can be helpful.
		- Often during this process, you will realize the source of the problem you are having.
	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! 🦆
4. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Sequence\|Sequence]]
	- Does sequence of statements matter? Yes.
5. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Iteration\|Iteration]]
	- A computer is very good at repeatedly doing the same thing.
	- We can use a loop to describe what instructions should be repeated.
	- We say that a computer *iterates* when it repeatedly runs a set of instructions.
6. Introduce [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing\|Campus Line Drawing]] task
	- Complete a walk around campus to find suitable locations.
6. Working time in class
	- If needed:
		- [ ] polish your Spaces posts
		- [ ] finish up the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate task]] task
	- Or:
		- [ ] begin the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing\|Campus Line Drawing]] task.
 
#### To-do items
*Before our next class, please...*

- [ ] If requested in my replies to your [Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) posts, please provide additional information.
- [ ] Make some progress on the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing\|Campus Line Drawing]] task.
	- ==NOTE==: You will also have class time over the next several periods to work on this task.
	- [ ] For the Campus Line Drawing task, please be sure to make a post [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) at the end of each class (or at the end of Study time in the evening)
		- Here are the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing#Reflection prompts\|reflection prompts]].

### Thread 1, Day 4 - Wednesday, September 21, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Finish the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate task]].
	- Be certain you made a plan.
		- Share a photo of your plan [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/).
		- Review the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Name Plate#Exemplar\|exemplar]] for a plan carefully.
	- Be sure to respond to the reflection questions on Spaces.
2. Optionally, to enhance your portfolio of work, make additions to your name plate sketch.
	- Consider adding small line drawing(s) of something that connects to your interests.
		- For example, for me, that would be baseball and the Blue Jays. 😎 So, I might try using the `addArc` command to have the turtle draw a circle, and then attempt to make a drawing of a baseball near my name. Something like this would be a good challenge:
		  ![baseball.jpg](/img/user/Attachments/baseball.jpg)
		- Note that with the `addArc` command you can draw parts of a full circle by using an angle less than 360°.
	- Completing an extension like this would be great additional evidence for [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Learning Goals#2\|learning goal 2]].
 
#### To-do items
*Before our next class, please...*

- [ ] Be sure you've completed all the expectations of the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate task]].
