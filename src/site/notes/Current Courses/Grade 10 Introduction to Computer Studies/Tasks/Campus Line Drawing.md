	- [ ] describes at least some of the necessary turtle movements
- [ ] a recognizable rendering of a location on campus is drawn in Playgrounds
- [ ] iteration is used, when possible, to author more efficient code
- [ ] work is created over several classes, acting on feedback received through regular Spaces posts
- [ ] code includes [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Style/Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent\|concise comments that describe intent]]
