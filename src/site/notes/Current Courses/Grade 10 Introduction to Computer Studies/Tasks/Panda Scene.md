# Panda Scene
## Objective
Create a passable scene that includes a panda to refresh your understanding of why *sequence* – order of statements – matters when writing code.
## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] The [[Software Setup/Playgrounds\|Playgrounds]] app installed on your computer
- [ ] A copy of [version 5.0 of the Sketches playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/067aWMvIpKPy582rk6zbL31wg#Turtle_Sketches_Template_-_v5), added to the Playgrounds app and [[Media/Install and Duplicate New Turtle Sketches Template\|duplicated to get ready for this task]] 
- [ ] Your black, hardcover, graph paper notebook

## Success criteria
- [ ] a hand-drawn plan is made using a storyboard approach, to help think through the necessary sequence of steps to create at least *part* of your drawing
- [ ] a recognizable image of a panda is drawn in Playgrounds
- [ ] good use of fills, borders, and color is applied to create a background scene
- [ ] code includes [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Style/Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent\|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Style/Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently\|correctly indented]]
- [ ] Playground is regularly backed up [[Media/Duplicating a Sketch in Playgrounds\|by making duplicates]], using filenames like:
	- `Panda Scene`
	- `Panda Scene v2`
	- `Panda Scene v3`
	- *`et cetera`*

## Exemplar

This rough plan does not include any co-ordinates and does not need to – the numbered storyboards make it clear what order shapes will be drawn in, and when those shapes will be filled:

This finished product makes great use of overlapping shapes to create a compelling scene:

## Exploring and Getting Started
Version 5 of the Turtle Sketches Template brings significant new functionality.

As always, try typing `turtle.` to see what capabilities the `Tortoise` offers:

Here is an example showing the code that reproduces the start of the exemplar:

> [!TIP]
> Remember to use [[Media/Using Autocomplete and Keyboard Shortcuts\|keyboard shortcuts and the autocomplete features of the Playgrounds app]] to your advantage. You can press the `Tab` key to move between placeholders.
