# T-Shirt Shadow Prints
## Objective
Create a design that when inverted, will look appealing when [printed with sunlight-activated dye on a T-shirt](http://www.inkodye.com/guides/photo).
## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] The [[Software Setup/Playgrounds\|Playgrounds]] app installed on your computer
- [ ] A copy of [version 4.1 of the Sketches playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/030Bsp7EIEhY1TnLkzuz9v76w#Turtle_Sketches_Template_v4-1), added to the Playgrounds app [[Media/Adding the New Sketches Template to Playgrounds\|by drag and drop]]
- [ ] Your black, hardcover, graph paper notebook
- [ ] Writing instruments, including a ruler or straight edge
- [ ] An image to reproduce, possibilities include:
	- [optical illusion art](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=optical+illusion+art+using+straight+lines)
	- [line art to create a sense of perspective](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=line+art+perspective)
	- [geometric animal art](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=geometric+animal+line+art)

> [!NOTE]
> You are welcome to create an original image of your own design, if you are confident this will not be too time-consuming.
## Success criteria
- [ ] a hand-drawn plan is made that:
	- [ ] includes a scale
	- [ ] uses lines, optionally curves, and fills, to create an image
	- [ ] describes at least some of the necessary turtle movements
- [ ] iteration is used, when possible, to author more efficient code
- [ ] work is created over several classes, acting on feedback received through regular [Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) posts
- [ ] code includes [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Style/Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent\|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Style/Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently\|correctly indented]]
- [ ] Playground is regularly backed up by making duplicates

> [!NOTE]
> Correct use of [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Functions\|functions]] is optional but would be one way to exceed expectations on this task.
## Exemplar
A plan for a design that includes a scale:
