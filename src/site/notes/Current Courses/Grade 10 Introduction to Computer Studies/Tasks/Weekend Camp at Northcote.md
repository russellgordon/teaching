# Weekend Camp at Northcote
*Using Spreadsheets to Create Business Documents*
<small>Adapted from material by Jack Scorcia, North Park Secondary School, Peel DSB</small>
## Objective
Understand how a spreadsheet can be used as a budget planning tool for events.
## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] In your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com), a folder named **Weekend Camp at Northcote** to hold documents for this task. Share the folder with your partner and Mr. Gordon.
- [ ] A spreadsheet titled **Weekend Camp at Northcote**, saved in the folder you just created.
## Guidance
- Remember the cardinal rule of designing spreadsheets: *do not put numerical values in formulas*. Formulas should always reference cells, which in turn contain the numbers.
> [!TIP]
> In Google Sheets, you can use the keyboard shortcut **Control \`** to toggle cells so that formulas are shown, instead of computed values. This is a quick way to determine whether you are following the rule given above. Press **Control \`** a second time to make cells show computed values again.

## Background
With your peers in your Outdoor Education class, you are going to offer a Victoria Day long weekend skills camp for Kawartha-area children aged 9 to 12. 

The camp will take place on our Northcote campus and is intended to teach skills of some kind. This may involve sports skills, artistic skills, or some other set of plausible skills that parents would be willing to send their children to camp to learn – and that kids would want to paticipate in.

Participants will camp overnight for two nights.

Your teachers will provide passive supervision and organize meals.

You may also assume that tents for participants are provided by LCS.

You and your partner have the responsibility of planning events and budgeting. This involves considering what items are needed to operate those events. In turn, you will determine a reasonable fee to charge participants.

### Part 1: Revenue

*Revenue* represents the total dollar amount of funds collected from camp participants.

- Estimate the number of campers that will participate.
- Establish an *initial* fee for each camper.
- Calculate the total projected revenue using an appropriate formula or function.

> [!NOTE]
> As you build out your spreadsheet, you will end up adjusting your fee to meet other requirements of this task. For now, simply pick an initial amount that you feel would be reasonable to charge families.

### Part 2: Inventory of Required Equipment

Consider the type of skills your camp will teach participants, and the events that will be run.

Build a table with the headers shown within a section of your spreadsheet to track what items need to be purchased:

| **Item Description** | **Unit Price** | **Shared By Count** | **Units Required** | **Subtotal** | **HST** | **Total** | **Supplier Page** |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | 
| &nbsp; |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| &nbsp; |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
| &nbsp; |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 

Your table should have enough rows to track at least 10 items that need to be purchased.

Each column holds the following information:

- **Item Description**: Short description of the item being purchased.
- **Unit Price**: The price, without tax, to purchase one item.
- **Shared By Count**: The number of people who can share one item during an activity.
- **Units Required**: Use your estimate of how many participants there will be at the camp and the "Shared By Count" for an item to determine how many units of an item should be purchased. 
> [!TIP]
> If there are 40 people at the camp, and one item can be shared by 2 people during an activity, then 20 units of that item must be purchased to run the activity.
- **Subtotal**: The cost, without tax, to purchase the quantity of units required for an item.
- **HST**: The dollar amount of **Harmonized Sales Tax** that will be charged to purchase the required quantity of items. 
> [!NOTE]
> The HST rate in Ontario is currently 13%, but this may change in the future – keep in mind that your teachers may want to re-use your spreadsheet to plan events in upcoming years.
- **Total**: The sum of the subtotal and HST values.
- **Supplier Page**: The name of the supplier, with a link that goes directly to the web page that lists the relevant information.
> [!TIP]
> You can use the keyboard shortcut `Command-K` to create a link, like this: [Canadian Tire](https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/rawlings-wicked-softball-bat-30-in-19-oz-0804560p.html#srp).

### Part 3: Expenses

- Refer to the inventory list created in part 2.
- LCS has a policy to prefer purchases from local suppliers, whenever possible – *buy local*.
	- To help your teachers review your list of proposed purchases with regard to the buy local policy, the total dollar amount spent at each supplier needs to be broken out into separate line items.
- Include another section for other expenses, such as shipping costs for  purchases.
	- There will be a one-time expense of $500 for a large tent rental that will cover a meal preparation and dining area at the camp.
- Use appropriate formulas or functions to calculate the total expenses (cost) of ordering all required items.

### Part 4: Projected Income

*Income* is the dollar amount remaining once expenses are subtracted from revenue.

- Take note of the cell that contains your total projected revenue.
- Take note of the cell that contains your total expenses.
- Calculate your total net income using an appropriate formula or function.

==Your projected net income must be a minimum of $1000.==

> [!TIP]
>  ∙ What have you charged each camper to participate?
>  ∙ How many campers must register to reach your target income?
>  
>  Adjust these values to meet the required net income value.

### Part 5: HST by Retailer

- Educational institutions can apply to the government for HST rebates.
	- To apply for the rebate, the Accounting department needs to know the total amount of HST paid to each supplier.
	- Include a section that makes these dollar amounts clear.

### Part 6: Polish

A spreadsheet is a tool for communication about numbers, often to support a point of view, convince an audience, or make a proposal.

Please add the following "polish" items to your spreadsheet:
- A header containing an appropriate logo.
> [!TIP]
> The [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com) is a great source for logos.
- The names of you and your partner.
- Attractive formatting and layout so that the sections of your spreadsheet are clear.
- Include a section noting any assumptions made when you created your budget.
	- Assmptions must be reasonable, or your OE teachers will ask you to resubmit your budget forecast.

## Exemplar

Here is an exemplar that meets *most* of the requirements listed above:

Some notes:
- This is just one possible layout; you do not need to match it.
	- There are some advantages to this vertical layout, but one disadvantage is that columns are shared between multiple tables.
		- This can sometimes make layout a challenge.
	- You might consider building a spreadsheet with a more horizontal layout, so that columns are not shared between different tables.
- Total projected net income is below the $1000 threshold.
	- The authors need to make some adjustments to their camper count or fee per camper to ensure they meet the required threshold.
- Only the cells highlighted in yellow contain data that was typed directly into the cell.
	- All other cells contain formulas.
	- The goal is to write a spreadsheet that recomputes as many values as possible automatically.

## Reflection prompts
1. What problems did you encounter when completing this task? How did you and your partner resolve them?
2. How did your spreadsheet layout make calculations easier or harder?

When the task is completed, make a post on [Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com) in your private portfolio space to:
- [ ] share a link to your group's work on this task
