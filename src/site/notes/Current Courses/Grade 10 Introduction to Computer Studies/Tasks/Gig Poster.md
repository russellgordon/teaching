# Gig Poster

## Objective
Loosely follow the [style of Swiss modernism as illustrated by Mike Joyce's work](https://www.swissted.com) and create your own custom gig poster for an [actual concert that has occured in the past](https://www.concertarchives.org) for a given band or musical artist that you like.

## What you'll need to begin
- [ ] The [[Software Setup/Playgrounds\|Playgrounds]] app installed on your computer
- [ ] A duplicate of [version 5.1 of the Sketches playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/056s04aZ5PGT9qasJSphxOUXA#Turtle_Sketches_Template_-_v5-1) named **My Gig Poster**
> [!NOTE]
> You can [[Media/Duplicating Gig Poster Playground\|duplicate any existing version 5.1 playground]]. Feel free to keep and then modify existing code from a poster you have already made.
- [ ] Your black, hardcover, graph paper notebook
- [ ] Pencil, ruler, eraser

## Success criteria
- [ ] a hand-drawn plan is made using either a:
	- storyboard approach
		- e.g.: you illustrate, step by step, what parts of the poster you will draw in what order
	 - sketch of entire poster
		 - e.g.: you analyse your sketch and:
			 - [ ] number key elements in the order they will be drawn (sequence)
			 - [ ] identify numerical patterns in the position of elements (where iteration might be used)
			 - [ ] identify similar visual elements in your poster (where abstraction using functions might be used)
	
> [!NOTE]
> Your plan *must* be [shared on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) and approved by Mr. Gordon prior to starting to write code. 

 - • to meet expectations, your code should:
	- [ ] show an understanding of *sequence* by producing output that matches your plan
	- [ ] show an understanding of *iteration* by using loops to draw repeated elements

- • to exceed expectations, your code should:
	- [ ] show an understanding of *abstraction* by making use of functions that include parameters
	- [ ] show an understanding of *selection* by making use of `if` statements

- [ ] use [color combinations that are appealing](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/#organic-color-inspiration)

> [!NOTE]
> You may use the eyedropper tool to sample [colors from the examples shown](https://www.canva.com/learn/100-color-combinations/#organic-color-inspiration).

- [ ] code should include [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Style/Well Formatted Code#Use Comments to Describe Intent\|concise comments that describe intent]]
- [ ] code is [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Style/Well Formatted Code#Indent Code Consistently\|correctly indented]]
- [ ] Playground is regularly backed up [[Media/Duplicating a Sketch in Playgrounds\|by making duplicates]], using filenames like:
	- `My Gig Poster`
	- `My Gig Poster v2`
	- `My Gig Poster v3`
	- *`et cetera`*

> [!NOTE]
> Create a [[Media/Showing That Regular Backups Were Made\|short screen recording like this one]] to show that your poster was backed up regularly, then [share it on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/). Note how seven versions of the playgrounds were made across an hour – a new version made after each significant bit of progress. You must show the backups made using the list view in Finder.

- [ ] poster must be for an [actual concert that occurred in the past](https://www.concertarchives.org)


## Exemplar

### Plan

Any of the plans shared for lessons in this module would be suitable:

- [[Media/Blur Poster Plan\|Blur]]
	- Good example identifying sequence (order to draw things in)
	- How to use iteration (analysis to determine where loop)
- [[Media/Replacements Poster Plan\|Replacements]]
	- Identifies sequence
	- Analyses where functions might be used
	- Details on how to draw parts of design shown
- [[Media/Refused Poster Plan\|Refused]]
	- Good detail anlaysing how two loops can be used to draw pattern

### Product

You *must* post about your progress at multiple points while you write your code.

Here is an example from last year:

> [!NOTE]
> Last year students used a slightly different programming environment. You will of course post screenshots from Playgrounds, as usual. Be sure to include screenshots of both your code and the visual output.

## Handing in your work

Please [submit your playground to this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9-9cXs7-So0I4RFkgxi0eS0JoGtwZn00YffrH_vv5zXiG_w/viewform) using drag and drop. You are encouraged to submit multiple copies of your playground as you are likely to make improvements over time based on feedback received from peers and your teacher.
> [!Tip]
> Remember, you must use the Safari web browser when submitting a playground for drag and drop to work.

## Reflection prompts
For each class that you work on this task, please post a screenshot of your progress on [Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com), and answer these questions:
1. What did I learn or make progress upon today?
2. What do I have questions about / what am I struggling with?
## Learning goals
Successful completion of this task is great evidence of mastery for learning goals [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Learning Goals#1\|1]], [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Learning Goals#2\|2]], and [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Learning Goals#3\|3]].
