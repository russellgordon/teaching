### Thread 2, Day 12 - Tuesday, December 13, 2022
#### Agenda

1. [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
	- You are encouraged to bring your ðŸ¦† to class!
	- You will run into all sorts of errors â€“ syntax and logical errors â€“ this is *normal*.
	- Explaing your code, line by line to your duck, and comparing that code to what you *intend* to do is a valid and useful debugging approach.
2. Submitting Final Versions of Playgrounds
	- Please use the Google Forms listed at the bottom of our home page to submit your final versions of playgrounds, as they are completed.
	> [!NOTE]
	> These submissions are in addition to your regular posts on Spaces that are made to share your progress for each task.
2. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Exercises/Gig Posters - Applying Abstraction|Gig Posters: Applying Abstraction]]
	- Learn how to use functions to draw visually similar elements within a gig poster.
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Exercises/Exercise - Superdrag|Exercise: Superdrag]]
	- Apply your understanding of *iteration* using loops and *abstraction* using functions to reproduce this gig poster.
