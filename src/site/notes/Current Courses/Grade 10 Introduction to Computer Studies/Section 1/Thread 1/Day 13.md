### Thread 1, Day 13 - Tuesday, October 11, 2022
#### Agenda
1. Please hand in the final version of your Campus Line Drawing playground to [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfgvy6K9Y1TzBLw6J2OqjClI39Vj5f-x6wlil2kqE9wH1tVKQ/viewform).
	- Here is a [[Media/Handing in your Campus Line Drawing|short animation showing how to hand in your drawing]].

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please double check that you are handing in the correct file by first running the playground file before handing it in.

2. Filling Shapes
	- The [latest version of the Turtle Sketches playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/030Bsp7EIEhY1TnLkzuz9v76w#Turtle_Sketches_Template_v4-1), version 4.1, allows for shapes to be filled.
	- Use black, white, and shades of grey only (recall the [process we are using to transfer designs to a shirt](http://www.inkodye.com/guides/photo)).
	- To "turn off" fills, [[Media/Using a Clear Fill Colour|set the fill color to "clear"]].

3. Finish the [[Tasks/T-shirt Shadow Prints|T-shirt Shadow Prints]] task.
	- Please [hand in your T-Shirt Shadow Prints playground to this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfwa6DH8Ylbvn45avDXNTmyqi2c-4BYp4h0mvsYicFdmxBtiw/viewform), using the same drag and drop process you used to hand in your Campus Line Drawing.

> [!NOTE]
> Designs must be handed in by the end of today's class, so that Mr. Gordon has time to print your design before our next class when T-shirts will be printed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please double check that you are handing in the correct file by first running the playground file before handing it in.
