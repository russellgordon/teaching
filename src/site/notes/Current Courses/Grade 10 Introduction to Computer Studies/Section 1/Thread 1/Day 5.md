### Thread 1, Day 5 - Thursday, September 22, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [Keyboard shortcuts in Playgrounds](https://www.russellgordon.ca/tutorials/keyboard-shortcuts-in-playgrounds/) allow you to work more efficiently.
	- Bookmark that page for future reference.
2. [Rubber Duck Debugging](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)
	- Programming can be hard, both for beginners and experienced software developers.
	- If you are running into syntax errors or logical errors and perhaps getting frustrated: that is normal!
	- Pairing with a friend to describe what you are trying to do with your code, line by line, can be helpful.
		- Often during this process, you will realize the source of the problem you are having.
	- When a friend is not nearby, [use your duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! 🦆
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Sequence\|Sequence]]
	- Does sequence of statements matter? Yes.
4. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Concepts/Iteration\|Iteration]]
	- A computer is very good at repeatedly doing the same thing.
	- We can use a loop to describe what instructions should be repeated.
	- We say that a computer *iterates* when it repeatedly runs a set of instructions.
5. Introduce [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing\|Campus Line Drawing]] task
	- Complete a walk around campus to find suitable locations.
6. Working time
- If needed, finish up the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Name Plate\|Name Plate task]] task or begin the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing\|Campus Line Drawing]] task.

 
#### To-do items
*Before our next class, please...*

- [ ] Make some progress on the [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing\|Campus Line Drawing]] task.
	- ==NOTE==: You will also have class time over the next several periods to work on this task.
	- [ ] For the Campus Line Drawing task, please be sure to make a post [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) at the end of each class (or at the end of Study time in the evening)
