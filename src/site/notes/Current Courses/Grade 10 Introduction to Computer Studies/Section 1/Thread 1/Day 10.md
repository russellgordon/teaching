### Thread 1, Day 10 - Monday, October 3, 2022
#### Agenda
1. [Updated Sketches Playground](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/030Bsp7EIEhY1TnLkzuz9v76w#Turtle_Sketches_Template_v4-1)
	- Please download this new version, which allows for line by line debugging and some other useful features.
2. Using Functions with Parameters
	- Today's lesson about how to use functions to make regular polygons could have been clearer.
	- Here are the main points I want you to know:
		- Functions are used to "teach the computer a new trick".
			- The formal word for this is *encapsulation* which means we wrap up many steps into a function so we can simply use, or *call*, the function in a single step, or line, or code.
		- Functions are made more useful when we can pass information to them.
		- Here is a simpler example that gets the same general point across that we explored today:

#### To-do items
*Before tomorrow's class, please...*
- [ ] As a first priority, finish your [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing\|Campus Line Drawing]] task if it is not complete â€“ with an update [on Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) when you are done, responding to the provided [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Tasks/Campus Line Drawing#Reflection prompts\|reflection prompts]].
- [ ] Otherwise, spend some time creating a few [Spirograph-like](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=spirograph+art) forms.
	- ==NOTE==: You can use squares (as shown in the function above) of various sizes to make some fairly interesting Spirograph-like forms, if you did not get the `polygon` function discussed in class today working.
