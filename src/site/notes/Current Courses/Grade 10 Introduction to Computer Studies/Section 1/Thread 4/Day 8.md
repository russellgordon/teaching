### Thread 4, Day 8 - Tuesday, May 9, 2023
#### Agenda

1. [Continuing the Culminating Task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rfwPgUBdPFql629WaOHJWa6-I4iEx76t/view?usp=share_link)
	- Continue working on your culminating task
	- Work on a second or third tessellation if you have completed your first one
	- Interested in trying a different type of design? Ask Mr. Gordon for more details...
	> [!TIP]
	> Please remember to:
	> 1. Make a plan and share it [to Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) before you write code.
	> 2. Keep your code organized, by:
	> 	- Selecting meaningful names for functions (custom blocks).
	> 	- Using comments to identify the purpose of a section of code.
	> 3. Look for ways to exceed expectations, such as:
	> 	- use of colour 
	> 	- use of fills
	> 	- creating multiple tessellations
	> 4. When you post on Spaces, use subject-specific vocabulary to provide some details about *how* you completed the tessellation. 
	> 	- Where was sequence important?
	> 	- When did you use iteration?
	> 	- Where did you apply abstraction, and how does that help?
