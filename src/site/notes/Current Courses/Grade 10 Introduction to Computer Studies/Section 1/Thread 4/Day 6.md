### Thread 4, Day 6 - Thursday, May 4, 2023
#### Agenda

1. Weekend Portfolio Review
	- Additions to portfolios made since the start of this module will be reviewed this weekend
	- A new grade will be set in Edsby; this will be your "term" grade which in turn comprises 70% of your final grade
	- All parts of the [culminating task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u38zFv5pM8oAZX8ToLfufQNDvfuUKy60/view?usp=share_link) comprise the remaining 30% of your final grade – the "end of year" portion
2. [Continuing the Culminating Task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rfwPgUBdPFql629WaOHJWa6-I4iEx76t/view?usp=share_link)
	- A brief look at using variables in TurtleStitch to control sizing
	- A look at [the template to help you prepare](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EKc4D5fXJqFSlWczhIO9K1U4i8qMq-LqbkqL0wok1Bg/copy) for the end of year interview.
	- Continue implementation of your first design for the culminating task
	> [!TIP]
	> Please remember to:
	> 1. Make a plan and share it [to Spaces](https://ca.spacesedu.com/) before you write code.
	> 2. Keep your code organized, by:
	> 	- Selecting meaningful names for functions (custom blocks).
	> 	- Using comments to identify the purpose of a section of code.
	> 3. Look for ways to exceed expectations, such as:
	> 	- use of colour
	> 	- use of fills
	> 	- creating multiple tessellations
	> 4. When you post on Spaces, use subject-specific vocabulary to provide some details about *how* you completed the tessellation. 
	> 	- Where was sequence important?
	> 	- When did you use iteration?
	> 	- Where did you apply abstraction, and how does that help?
