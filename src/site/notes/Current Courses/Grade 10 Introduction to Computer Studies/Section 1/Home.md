### Thread 2, Day 12 - Tuesday, December 13, 2022

	> [!NOTE]

	- Learn how to use functions to draw visually similar elements within a gig poster.
3. [[Current Courses/Grade 10 Introduction to Computer Studies/Exercises/Exercise - Superdrag|Exercise: Superdrag]]
	- Apply your understanding of *iteration* using loops and *abstraction* using functions to reproduce this gig poster.
