### Thread 2, Day 15 - Monday, December 19, 2022
#### Agenda

1. Acknowledging Replies on Spaces + Iterative Improvement
	- It takes a *lot* of effort to reply to everyone's posts on Spaces. 🥵
	- I know you *are* reading the replies, but could you indicate that you've done so by giving an emoji reaction, or just a short reply? 
	- This would be much appreciated. 🙏🏼

> [!NOTE]
> If a change or improvement is suggested in the feedback I've given in my reply to your post, it's ideal if you make time to follow through on the feedback given and actually make the changes or improvements suggested. Of course, be sure to share those improvements with a follow-up post in your portfolio. All of that demonstrates growth and learning! 💪🏼
